(ii) The Lord alone is to be worshipped, and that only by doings
one’s own duties. Any other worship or duty should be
abandoned.

(iii) Devotion to the Lord is the mean to which all the rest is
subservient;

(iv) The Lord is far different from the whole world and every-
thing is under His control. He is the Supreme being, perfect
in every excellence.

(v) The human being is obliged to perform his duties without
hoping for the fruits which he may get out of his perfor-
mance.

‘Srimad Bhagavad Gita’ has been translated into several
languages, and each translation has been reviewed and com-
mented in different ways. But this edition of Bhagavad Gita has
its own distinction. It contains the original sanskrit text (shloka
by shloka) with its translation into Hindi as also in English. We
hope that this edition will enlighton not only those readers who
read it from religious view point, but also to those who want to
study this great literary work.

It has been brought out in comparatively bolder type so that
it can be easily read by readers of all ages.
