going to be born in the (ensuing) Kali age. (61) Sipping with the hollow of his joined palms
in the form of his ears but once from the holiest stream of His glory, which is nectar to the
ears of the righteous, a man shakes off the tendencies of actions (standing in the way of
Liberation). (62) Through words sweetened by His loving smiles and glances, His valourous
pastimes and (divine) personality, charming in every limb, He brought joy to mankind, His
activities being ever praised by the Bhojas, Vrsnis, Andhakas, Madhus, Strasenas and
Dasarhas (on the one hand) and by the Kurus, Srfjayas and Pandus on the other. (63-64)
Drinking, full of joy, with their eyes the beauty of His face—rendered (all the more) lovely by
ears adored with alligator-shaped ear-rings and lustrous cheeks, (nay,) lit up with a
graceful smile and ever steeped in joy—men and women not only did not feel sated but grew
angry with Nimi* (who was responsible for the twinkling of their eyes, that interrupted the joy
flowing from his sight). (65) As soon as born, Sri Krsna (the supreme Person) went to the
dales of Vraja from His father’s house (at Mathura) and, having heightened the joy of the
residents of Vraja, returned to Mathura, slew enemies , married numerous wives, begot
through them hundreds of sons, and worshipped His own Self by means of (a number of)
sacrifices in order to popularize His own Vedic path (leading to His realization). (66) Intending
to reduce the heavy burden of the earth by means of the internal discord appearing among
the Kurus, He swept away by His (mere) glance the armies of kings on the battle-field, loudly
proclaimed far and wide the victory of Vijaya (Arjuna), taught the highest truth to (His beloved
disciple) Uddhava and returned with an easy mind to His own (divine) Abode. (67)

Thus ends the twenty fourth discourse, entitled “An account of the posterity of Yadu",
forming part of an account of the solar and lunar dynasties (of kings),
in Book Nine of the great and glorious Bhagavata-Purana,
otherwise known as the Paramahamsa-Samhita,
composed by the sage Vedavyasa and consisting
of eighteen thousand Slokas.

Vasistha—sought and secured a boon from the gods by virlue of which he resides in a subtle form in the eyelide of all living
beings and directs their closing and opening.
