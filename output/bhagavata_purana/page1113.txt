When, accompanied by Bala and gracefully adorned with floral ear-rings, and standing
on the summits of the mountain (Govardhana), O beauties of Vraja, Sri Krsna fills the
universe with the sound of His flute, enrapturing all and filled with delight (Himself), the cloud
rumbles in gentle tones (as if) keeping time with His tune, and afraid at heart (as it were) of
showing disrespect to the Great One, and covers his Friend with a shower of flowers (in the
form of spray), spreading over Him an umbrella with his shadow. (12-13)

When, placing the flute between His lips, ruddy as a (ripe) Bimba fruit, O Yasoda (a
virtuous lady), your Son, an expertin the various games played by cowherds, evolves varied
original tunes in the domain of flute-playing, the chiefs of the gods headed by Indra, Lord Siva
(the god of destruction) and Brahma (the highest functionary of the universe) listen to that
music again and again with their neck and mind inclined (towards the quarter from which the
sound comes) and, unable to penetrate into its subtleties, learned as they are, fall into
confusion. (14-15)

When, playing on His flute, Sri Krsna walks with the gait of an elephant (the foremost of
all creatures in point of bulk), soothing the pain of the soil of Vraja caused by the hoofs of the
cattle (treading on it) by (the soles of} His own (tender) feet resembling the petals of a lotus
and bearing the weird marks of a flag, thunderbolt, lotus and goad, we—in whom are fire of
love is kindled by His amorous glances and who are reduced to the (insensate) state of trees
by (the sight of) His (graceful) movements—are no longer conscious of our braid or (even)
of our dress due to infatuation. (16-17)

Whenever, wearing (a string of) beads (of various colours) and counting the (herds of)
cows (with the help of those beads) and resting His arm on the shoulder of a loving follower,
Srikrsna, adorned with a wreath of Tulasi flowers, the fragrance of which is (so) dear to Him,
sings somewhere (on His flute), the she-deer, the companions of black antelopes, whose
mind is carried away by the music of His sounding flute, continue to be with Sri Krsna, the
ocean of virtues, once they meet Him, having abandoned like (us,) the cowherd women (all)
hopes of returning to their home. (18-19)
