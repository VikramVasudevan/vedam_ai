Concealing by Their actions—which looked (more or less) human—Their unclouded wisdom,
that had not been acquired through another, and Seeking to reside in the house of a preceptor
(with the object of attaining knowledge in order to set an example before the world), the two
Brothers, who were the omniscient Rulers of the universe and the source of all learning, now
actually sought the presence of a Brahmana of Ujjain, Sandipani (the son of Sandipana) by
name, born in the family of Kaga. (30-31) Having duly approached him the two Brothers
tamely and reverently waited upon him as a god with devotion, (thereby) teaching (to the
world) irreproachable behaviour towards one's preceptor. (32) Gratified with Their services
rendered with genuine devotion, Sandipani (the teacher), the foremost ofB rahmanas, taught
them all the (four) Vedas alongwith the (six) auxiliary branches of learning (viz., Siksa or
phonetics, Chanda or prosody, Vyakarana or grammar, Jyotisa or astronomy, Kalpa or the
Science prescribing the ritual and giving rules for ceremonial or sacrificial acts and Nirukta
or etymology) and the Upanisads (the crowning part of the Veda expounding the secret
meaning of the Vedas and treating of Brahma) as well as Dhanurveda (the science of
archery) including its secrets (viz., the knowledge of Mantras by means of which the various
Astras or mystic missiles are invoked andthe deities presiding over them), the Dharmagastras
(codes of laws such as the Manusmrti) and the various systems of philosophy (such as
Mimarnsa) as wellas the science of logic and the science of politics with its six branches (viz.,
those dealing with peace, warfare, expedition, encampment, exciting dissension or causing
the separation of allies and depending on one's allies). (33-34) The two Brothers, who were
jewels amongst the foremost of men and the Originators of all sciences, learnt everything in
a single lesson, O protector of men ! (35) With their mind fully controlled They mastered in
the course of sixty-four days and nights as many arts* and (then) persuaded the teacher to

end of the Vedic study.
