SriSuka continued: (Pariksit!) Bhagavan SriKrsna thus instructed the Gopis in spiritual
lore. Revolving that in their mind, again and again, the Gopis got rid of their ego-body and
became one with the Supreme Self. (48) They said, ” O Lord, from whose navel sprung the
lotus where Brahma, the creator, took His birth, the greatest of Yogis, possessed of infinite
wisdom, contemplate on Your lotus-like feet in their hearts. Your feet alone serve as the
support to enable people fallen in the abyss of mundane existence to get out of it. (O Lord,)
occupied as we are with our household duties, kindly bless us that Your lotus-feet may ever
remain present before our mental eyes, ( so that we may never forget them even for a
moment)." (49)

Thus ends the eighty-second discourse entitled "The Meeting of the Vrsnis with the Gopas and
Gopis of Vraja", in the latter half of Book Ten of the great and glorious Bhagavata-
Purana, otherwise known as the Paramahamsa-Samhita.

$ri Suka began again ; (Pariksit!} the almighty Lord (Bhagavan Sri Krsna) was the
Preceptor of the Gopis, as well as the goal (which they sought to attain through the practice
of His teachings). Having thus shown His favour to them, the Lord saw Yudhisthira and all
(other) friends and enquired about their welfare. (1) (Pariksit!) their sins disappeared at the
very sight of the lotus-feet of Bhagavan Sri Krsna. Kindly enquired after and duly honoured
by the Lord of the (three) worlds, they felt delighted at heart, and replied:—{2) “ (Blessed)
Lord, exalted souls enjoy with their mind the nectar of your lotus-feet, which occasionally
