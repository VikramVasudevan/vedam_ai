(stage of life) and given to (perfect) self-control, these foremost seers indeed wonderfully
attained absolute self-identity with the Lord, who is the very Self, nay, the Inner Controller
of all living beings and whom they realized within the heart, purified by virtue of their
uninterrupted and supreme Devotion resulting from their ceaseless remembrance of the
charming lotus-like feet of Bhagavan Vasudeva, the abode ofall species of living beings and
the asylum of the fear-stricken. (27) By another wife too he had three sons—Uttama, Tamasa
and Raivata, each of whom presided over a Manvantara (associated with his name). (28)

(Three of) his sons being thus given to self-control, the high-minded emperor (Priyavrata)
ruled over the globe for 1,10,00,00,000 years. (During his reign) the enemies of righteousness
were scared away by the very twang of the bow-string pulled by his stout arms, possessed
of (inordinate) strength, which consummated all his efforts without any obstruction. Nay, like
aman who has forgotten his self, he had his judgment clouded as it were by Barhismati's daily
growing expressions of excessive joy (on his visiting her), her rising from the seat and going
forth to meet him, amatory gestures natural to women, smiles and glances half-concealed
by bashfulness and delightful jokes etc. (29)

(Once he observed that) even to the extent the glorious sun-god lights the earth's surface
(viz., up to the Lokaloka mountain) in the course of his circuit round Mount Sumeru (the
mountain of the gods), he shines only on one-half of that portion and leaves the other half
shrouded in darkness. He (however) did not like this. His superhuman glory having been
enhanced by virtue of his adoration of-the Lord, he thereupon like another sun made seven
circuits (round the earth) after the sun, in his effulgent car, as swift as the sun, determined
to turn night as well into day. (30) The tracks that were sunk by the fellies of the wheels of
his chariot came to be the most celebrated seven oceans, which divided the earth into (what
are known as) the seven Dwipas (or main divisions). (31) The Dwipas are (severally) known
as Jambudwipa, Plaksadwipa, Salmalidwipa, Kugadwipa, Krauficadwipa, Sakadwipa and
Puskaradwipa. As regards dimensions, each succeeding one is twice as large as the
preceding one and is placed beyond the ocean and encircling it. (32) The seven oceans
(severally) contain salt water, the juice of sugar-cane, wine, clarified butter, milk, fluid curds
and pure water and serve as a moat as it were one for each of the seven Dwipas. They are
equal in extent to the Dwipa enclosed by them and are situated one beyond and encircling
