Meeting of Uddhava and Vidura
श्रीरुक उवाच
vata पृष्टो मैत्रेयो भगवान् किल। क्षत्नरा at प्रविष्टेन त्यक्त्वा स्वगृहमृद्धिमत् । १ |
यद्वा oad weet भगवानखिलेश्वर: ches हित्वा प्रविवेशात्मसात्कृतम्। २ |

Sri Suka said : It was this very question that Vidura asked the worshipful sage Maitreya
in the past, when the former had retired to the forest quitting his prosperous home. (1) It was
at Vidura's residence that Lord Sri Krsna, the Ruler of the universe, who happened to visit
Hastinapura as an ambassador of your forefathers (the Pandavas), called as if it were His
own house, refusing the hospitality of the Paurava king (Duryodhana). (2)

ex क्षत्तुर्भभवता मैत्रेयेणास सङ्गम: । कदा वा we dare एतद्वर्णय न: प्रभो । ३ ।
न ह्यल्पार्थोदयस्तस्य विदुरस्यामलात्मन: । तस्मिन् वरीयसि प्रश्न: साधुवादोपबृंहित: । ४ ।

The king said : Where did Vidura's meeting with’the worshipful Maitreya take place
and when didhe have a talk with him ? Kindly tell me all this, my lord. (3) Surely the question
which the pure-hearted Vidura asked of the noblest sage Maitreya could not have been of
small consequence, particularly when it was honoured with a reply by a saint of no mean
order. (4)

Yd उवाच

स एव्रमृषिवर्योऽयं ger wm परीक्षिता। प्रत्याह तं सुबहुवित्पीतात्मा श्रूयतामिति । ५ |

Sita continued : Questioned as above by king Pariksit and much delighted at heart over
this, the all-wise Suka, the foremost of sages, said in reply : "Listen !" (5)
