The king (Pariksit) said: Priyavrata was a (great) devotee of the Lord and revelled in
the Self. How did he, O sage, rejoice in family life, which obscures one's true nature and
subjects one to the bondage of actions ? (1)Certainly it is not desirable, O chief of the
Brahmanas, that people like him, who are free from attachment, should get identified with
their home in this way. (2) Indeed, O Brahmana sage, exalted souls whose mind has found
peace in the (cool) shade of the feet of Sri Hari (enjoying excellent renown)cannot conceive
a fond attachment to their family. (3) | have this great doubt in my mind, O holy Brahmana,
as to how Priyavrata, who was attached to his wife, house, children and so on, attained

pertection and (what is still more difficult) come to develop unswerving devotion to Lord Sri
Krsna. (4)
