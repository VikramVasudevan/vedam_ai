sense of the body and, having taken a vow of silence, remained mute even when accosted
by the people. (29) In towns and villages, mines and hamlets, flower-gardens and habitations
at the foot of hills, military encampments and cow-pens, in hutments of cowherds as well as
in the midst of caravans, in mountains and forests, hermitages and other places, wherever
He happened to be, He was insulted on every road—even as a wild elephant is assailed by
bees—by vile men, who threatened and (even) beat Him, passed urine and spat on Him
threw stones, dust and (even) ordure on Him, farted (in His face) and showered abuses on
Him. He (however) ignored (all) this inasmuch as He never looked upon, as His own self or
(even) as His own, this illusory habitat in the shape of a body, (wrongly) called as real—
established as He was in His own glory (glorious essence) consisting in the realization of both
being and non-being—and roamed about all alone on (this) earth with an undivided
(undistracted) mind. (30) Appearing in a (charming) form with very soft hands and feet and
chest, long and rounded arms, shoulders, and neck, an attractive face and other limbs (all)
symmetrically disposed, and a lovely mouth lit up with a spontaneous and naturally
captivating smile, He appeared (all the more) lovely with His reddish and large refreshing
eyes resembling the petals of a fresh, blown lotus. His cheeks, ears, neck and nostrils were
not only beautiful but uniformly shaped. By the extraordinary gracefulness of His face
adorned with an enigmatic smile He kindled love in the heart of the women of the city, and
with the curly yet.matted and auburn luxuriant hair flowing over His face as well as with His
uncared for and unclean body He looked like one possessed by a demon. (31)

When, however, the Lord saw this world directly opposed to His practice of Yoga as it
were, and the counteraction of such opposition reprehensible, He adopted the mode of life
of a python (remaining fixed to one spot and working out one's destiny) and not only ate,
drank and chewed (crisp articles of food) but also passed urine and stool lying down, rolling
in the faeces till all His limbs were thoroughly daubed with it. (32) The wind perfumed by the
fragrance of His excrement indeed surcharged with sweet smell the whole area within a
radius of eighty miles. (33) Similarly, living the life of a bull, deer or crow, he behaved (just)
like a bull, deer or crow andate, drank and passed urine while moving about, standing, sitting
or lying down. (34) Thus adopting various modes of life helpful to the practice of Yoga (in
order to set an example before Yogis striving to surmount obstacles in the way of their
practice of Yoga), Lord Rsabhadeva, the Dispenser of final beatitude—who embodied in
Himself the constant realization of the highest bliss—was endowed in the fullest measure
with all the objects of human pursuit, which were naturally present in Him, inasmuch as no
Vveilin the form of a subtle body existed between Him and Lord Vasudeva, the Soul ofall living
beings, with whom He was perfectly identified. That is why, O king, He did not welcome at
heart the (extraordinary) powers of Yoga that actually came to Him unsolicited in the form
of ability to traverse the air, acquiring the swiftness of thought, the power of remaining
invisible and entering a dead body, the faculty of seeing distant objects and hearing distant
sounds and so on. (35)
