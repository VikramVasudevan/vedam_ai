Sri Suka resumed : Now from the loins of a certain holy Brahmana—the foremost in
the line of the (celebrated) sage Angira ( a mind-born son of Brahma)—who had (duly)
controlled his mind and senses, was richin asceticism and the study of the Vedas, liberality,
endurance, modesty, the knowledge of rituals, freedom from jealousy, knowledge of the
Spirit (as distinct from the body etc.), and felicity (arising out of piety) were born through
the same mother nine sons—{all) like himself in learning, good character, purity of conduct,
comeliness of form, generosity and other virtues—and a son and a daughter (born as
twins) through the younger wife. (1) Of these twins the male child was, they say, (the same
as) that supreme devotee of the Lord, the foremost of royal sages, Bharata, who, having
shed his bestial form, had in that last incarnation attained the state of a Brahmana. ( 2)
Apprehending his fall through attachment to his people in that incarnation too and
(therefore) terribly afraid of such attachment—remembering as he did, by the grace of the
Lord, (the story of) a series of his previous incarnations—he showed himself to the world
as an insane, stupid, blind and deaf fellow, clasping firmly with his mind the Lord's lotus-
feet, that break asunder the fetters of Karma in the case of those who hear of those feet,
think of them or utter their praises. (3)

The Brahmana, whose heart was knit with (ties of parental) affection to the child, actually
performed all the Sarnskaras (purificatory rites) up to the ceremony of Samavartana*
(returning from the house of the preceptor after finishing one’s study of the Vedas) according
to precept even with respect to such a (stupid) son indeed, and, on the boy being invested
with the sacred thread, he further instructed him well in the method of personal purity, rinsing
his mouth (after easing nature, eating something and on other similar occasions) and other
rules of conduct—even though they were not liked (by the boy)—believing as he did that a
son must be instructed (in the rules of good conduct) by his father. (4) The child, however,
did everything (taught by his father) topsyturvy as it were in the very presence of his father,
with the result that the Brahmana, who wanted to start instructing him in the Vedas (as soon
as the rains set in) was able to teach the boy the three-footed (holy) Gayatri-Mantra (sacred
to the sun-god) along with the Vyahrtis (the mystic syllables Bhuh, Bhuvah and Swah,
prefixed to the Gayatri-Mantra each time it is repeated) and the-sacred syllable OM, the
(very) crown of the Vedic texts, only in a disjointed fashion (without proper intonation)
although he learnt it continuously all the (four) months of spring and summer. (5)

Having thus fondly given his heart to his son, who was his very self, he taught him
personal purity, the recitation (with proper intonation) of the Vedas, austerities, self-
discipline, service of the preceptor and offering worship to the (sacred) fire and other duties
of a religious student observing celibacy for a limited period only, even though they were

*The Brahmana had no intention to marry the boy obviously because he was stupid to all appearance. Hence there was

no occasion for the performance of other Sarhskaras beyond the ceremony of Samavartana, which is in ordinary cases closely
followed by the nuptial ceremony.
