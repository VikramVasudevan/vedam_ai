He (Sri Suka) said : The six Indriyas (the five senses of perception and their ruler, the
mind) are the only media (for the Jiva) of going through the beginningless (ordeal of)
metempsychosis in the shape of being united with and torn away from, as well as of
undergoing the pleasurable and painful experiences of, a series of (corporeal) bodies
brought into existence by virtuous, sinful or mixed actions—prompted by Sattva and other
qualities —on the part of human souls looking upon the body as their very self. Lured by
these into the aforesaid track, whichis as difficult to tread as a (mountain) defile, and swayed
by Maya (the principle of cosmic illusion that makes the Jiva forget his essentially blissful
character and seek delight without) functioning under the control of the all-powerful Lord
Visnu, the multitude of embodied souls mentioned heretofore, like a company of (itinerant)
traders intent on amassing wealth, enters the forest of worldly existence which is most
inauspicious like a crematorium and where they reap the fruit of actions wrought with their
own body. And, even though their endeavours (generally) prove abortive and are impeded
by many an obstacle, they fail even to this day to get to the path of those who resort like the
honey bee to the lotus-feet of Sri Hari in the form of their preceptor —the path (of Devotion)
which (when duly followed) relieves the agonies experienced in that forest, where dwell the
aforesaid six, which, though (passing as) Indriyas by name, are actually robbers by action.(1)
For whatever fortune —acquired with great hardship—belongs to a manis of use only when
itis directly conducive to (the practice of) Dharma (virtue); and that (alone) is Dharma, which
consists in the worship of the Supreme Person Himself and it is such Dharma that the wise
declare as contributory to happiness in the other world. In the case of those who are guided
by a perverted intellect and whose mind has not been subdued, as in the case of a company
of (itinerant) traders led by an unworthy chief and having an unsubdued spirit, the Indriyas
take away that wealth which is fit to be devoted to (the practice of) such virtue through the
medium of Sensuous enjoyment at home in the form of seeing, touching, hearing, tasting,
smelling, seeking after and determining (the nature of the various) objects. (2) Nay, in that
forest members of their family, wife and children by name but really wolves and jackals by
action, snatch away before their very eyes the wealth of those stingy householders, unwilling
though they are (to part with the same)—wealth which is being jealously guarded (by them)
