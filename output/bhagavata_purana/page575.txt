कर्तास्य सर्गादिषु चो न बध्यते न हन्यते देहगतोऽपि देहिकै:।

Again, in order to shower His grace (by setting a noble example) on those who have
controlled their mind, the Lord compassionately practises in Bharatavarsa (in the holy retreat
of Badarikagrama)—under the name of Nara-Narayana, till the end of the Kalpa, His
movements remaining unperceived—austerities, which, while enhancing one's religious merit,
enlightenment, aversion to the pleasures of sense, Yogic power, self-control and freedom from
egotism, (eventually) lead to Self-Realization. (9) Intending to instruct Savarni (one of the
prospective Manus, who is going to preside over the next or eighth Manvantara) in the
Paficaratra Agama (describing the greatness of the Lord) as well as in (the principles of)
Sankhya (the process of realizing Godas identical with oneself) and Yoga (the process of union
with the Lord as distinct from oneself) as taught by the Lord (Himself) in Srimad Bhagavadgita,
the glorious Narada, along with the people of Bharatavarsa, who follow the rules of Vamasrama
(the division of society into four Varnas or grades and four Agramas or stages in life), adores the
Lord (Nara-Narayana) with a feeling of supreme devotion and repeats the following
(prayer):—(10) "Hail to the Lord, denoted by the mystical syllable OM, who is given to self-
control and is (absolutely) free from the attributes of body and senses etc., (which are other than
the Self) ! Hail to Nara-Narayana, the foremost of sages, the wealth of those who have nothing
(to call their own) !! Hail, hail to the supreme Teacher of ascetics of the highest order and the
Lord of those who revel in the Self!!!" (11) Again, he sings the following (praises):—"Hail to
Him who, though the Maker of this (universe), does not get bound to the functions of creation
etc., (by recognizing Himself as the doer), who though invested with a body, is not affected by
the attributes of a body (hunger, thirst and so on) and whose vision, though He is all-seeing,
is not tainted by the qualities (of that which He sees)—(to sum up,) who is (absolutely)
unattached, pure and a (mere) witness. (12) Indeed here in, O’Master of Yoga, lies the
proficiency in Yoga (mind-control), of which the glorious Brahma (who was born of a golden
lotus sprung from the navel of Lord Visnu) has spoken, viz., that, having given up (all)
identification with the body, one should concentrate one's mind on You, who are beyond the
modes of Prakrti (all material phenomena), at the last moment (of one's life) through (the
practice of) Devotion (continued from one's very birth). (13) (All) effort (in the direction of
attaining wisdom through learning and other means) is mere (fruitless) labour on the part of
him who, though learned (well-versedin the scriptures) is afraid of the loss of (his) contemptible
(frail) body (even) like him (an ignorant person) who is addicted to the pleasures of this world
as well as of that (the other world), and anxious about his sons, wife and possessions. (14)
Therefore, administer You to us that (supreme) remedy in the form of loving devotion to You,
whereby we may (be able to) shake off soon, O Lord who are beyond sense-perception, the
feeling of ‘I’ and mine’ with respect to this contemptible (material) body, which (feeling) is so
difficult to renounce, occasioned as it is by Your Maya (deluding potency)." (15)
