associated with the three Gunas (modes of Prakrti), and no one invested with a body can help
doing action (with one's mind, speech or body). (44) He alone by whoma virtuous or sinful act
was performed in this world reaps in the other world the fruit of it in the same manner and to
the same extent it was actually done. (45) Just as in this world, O jewels among gods, there
are found three varieties of living beings (viz., those living a life of ease, those dragging a
miserable existence and those who are partly happy and partly miserable, or again those who
are tranquil by nature, those who are ferocious and those who are dull, or, according to a third
classification, those who are pious by temperament, those who are vicious by nature andthose
who are of a mixed temperament, and as this heterogeneity cannot be explained except by
assuming that the said three types of beings severally performed meritorious, sinful and mixed
deeds in the past), so from the diversity (in the proportion) of the three Gunas (manifested in
the form of virtuous, sinful and mixed types of actions on the part of men in this world) it is
inferred that they will reap the three corresponding types of fruit (in the form of happiness,
misery and a mixture of both) in another life. (46) (Again,) just as a current period of time
indicates the characteristics of the past as well as the future rounds of the same period, so the
current life (of a man) is illustrative of the merits and sins of the past as well as of the future
incarnations. (47) (Our master,) the omniscient Yama, who is (another) Brahma (as it were),
Clearly perceives (while) at his (own) capital (Sarnyamani) by his very mind the former state
of existence (including the record of virtuous and sinful deeds) of a departed soul and reflects
with his mind on his future (destiny) too. (48) (Even) as a man in sleep (the dream state) treats
as his self the body revealed in the dream alone and not the one existing before the dream
state nor that which will follow the dream state, so the ignorant Jiva (too) identifies itself with
its existing psycho-physical organism (the one revealed by its past actions) alone and has no
knowledge of the one preceding it nor of the succeeding one, having lost (all) memory of its
past incarnation. (49) The Jiva, itself constituting the seventeenth principle (over and above
the sixteen constituents of the subtle body, with which it stands identified, viz., the ten Indriyas,
the mind and the five objects of senses, viz., the subtle elements), discharges its own functions
(of grasping things, locomotion and so on) with the five organs of actions, perceives the five
objects of senses with the five senses of perception and experiences with the sixteenth (viz.,
the mind) the threefold objects of the senses of perception, the organs of action and the mind,
all alone. (50) This well-known subtle body, consisting of (the aforesaid) sixteen parts, and a
product of the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, endowed with the three potencies of
illumination, activity and obscuration respectively) and exceedingly tenacious, subjects the
Jiva again and again to transmigration, which is a source of joy and sorrow, fear and
affliction.(51) The ignorant Jiva (which stands identified with a body and), that has not subdued
the five senses of perception and the mind, is prompted (by that subtle body) to fall back upon
action, though unwilling (to do so), and veiling itself with a network of Karma, even asa silk-
worm wraps itself in a cocoon, stands bewildered (finding no way out of it). (52) Indeed none
remains actionless at any time even for an instant; for everyone is forcibly impelled—by
attachment etc. (born of the three Gunas—Sattva, Rajas and Tamas—and) resulting from the
impressions of past actions—to do action against his will. (53) Having found an occasion in
the form of merit or sin resulting from one's past actions, a psycho-physical organism
(consisting of a gross and a subtle body) actually moulds itself either after the womb (the
mother's body) or after the seed (the body of the father) accordingto the irresistible tendencies
of the Jiva (occupying it). (54) This degeneration of the soul (in the shape of loss of its blissful
character andits being reduced to a wretched state as a result of identifying itself with a psycho-
physical organism) has been due to its association with Prakrti (Matter). (And) the degenera-
tion ceases before long through devotion to God (and by no other means). (55)
