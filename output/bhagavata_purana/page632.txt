(viz., Prakrti or primordial matter, Purusa or the individual soul, Mahat-tattva or the principle
of cosmic intelligence, Ahankara or the ego and the five Tanmatras or subtle elements),
consisting of (or dominated by) the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas), as well as by
the sixteen other principles (viz., the mind and the five senses of perception, the five organs
of action and the five gross elements viz., earth, water, fire, air and ether)—(even) as those
well-versed in rituals produce the sacrificial fire hidden in (pieces of) wood by reciting the
fifteen sacred texts known as the Samidheni Mantras. (27) Indeed He is realized in the form
of the joy of Liberation when Maya (Prakrti), the source of all distinctions, has been negated
(by the process of elimination). (Yet) it is He who bears all names and assumes all forms,
possessed as He is of potencies toonumerous to be described and which constitute His very
essence. May He shower His grace on me. (28) Whatever is described in words, determined
with the intellect, or perceived with the senses or even pondered with the mind cannot be
His essential nature. For all that is a manifestation of the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas and
Tamas); while He, as a matter of fact, is (but) indicated by the evolution and dissolution of
the universe (which is a product of the Gunas as being the cause of such evolution and
dissolution). (29) Wherever, from whatever motive, by whatever means (or with whatever
instrument), for whomsoever (or whatever purpose), whatever, however and whosesoever
work whoever does (by himself) or is prompted (by someone else) to do, all that is Brahma,
which is their cause (and therefore identified with them) inasmuch as It is known to have
existed before them (all), and which is the ultimate cause of all (other) causes, both earlier
(such as Brahma) and later, and is without a second, whether of the same category or ofa
different kind. (30) Hail to that all-pervading Self, possessed of endless virtues, whose
manifold potencies (Prakrti and so on) indeed become the ground of disputation and
concurrence between theorists putting forward their claims (with eloquence), and delude
their mind now and again. (31) In Yoga (whichis primarily a system of religious worship) and
Sankhya (the science of Self-Realization), which, though professing faith in the one Reality
(viz., God), ascribe two distinct and mutually contradictory attributes to It—the one claiming
that (when conceived in the form of the Cosmic Person) It has hands and feet etc.,
(corresponding to Patala and the other Lokas), and the other denying them (and declaring
It as without name and form)—and (yet) have a common basis (in the shape of God), that
which is found to be common and beyond dispute (the dispute centring on the issue of Its
having hands and feet and so on) and which is (equally) acceptable to both (viz., God
Himself, whose existence is presupposed by both and who is the ground of all negation) is
Brahma (to whom all controversy relates). (32) May that almighty and infinite Supreme be
gracious to me—who, though devoid of (material) name and form, manifested from time to
time forms (consisting of Sattva unmixed with Rajas and Tamas) through descent (into the
world of matter) and names through (various) exploits, in order to shower His grace on those
who resort to the soles of His feet (for protection). (33) May that Lord grant my wish, who
though dwelling in the body of (all) men (as their formless Inner Controller), appears
diversified (in the form of different deities) according to their (individual) tendencies (formed
in previous lives) and in consonance with the systems of worship of recent origin (followed
by them), even as the air breathes fragrance of various kinds on coming in contact with the
odour of different flowers etc., (which is an attribute of earth) or appears dusky-white when
the colour of dust is transferred to it. (34)
