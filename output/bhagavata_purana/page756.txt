Withdrawing (dissolving) this cosmos into Yourself by Yourself (of Your own free will),
You repose in the Deluge water, enjoying the bliss which is Your very nature, and devoid of
(all) activity. Having closed Your eyes (in that state) through Yoga (Self-absorption) and set
aside sleep by Self-illumination, and existing in Your absolute nature (transcending the three
states of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep), You cognize neither Tamas (ignorance,
which is characteristic of deep sleep) nor the objects of senses (which are presented to one’s
mind during the states of wakefulness and dream). (32) This cosmos is an embodiment of
that very Lord in You, who spurred into activity, by Your own energy in the shape of the Time-
Spirit, the (three) modes of Prakrti (viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, which combine to produce
this universe). (For) from Your navel—(even) as You reposed in water on the (cosy) bed of
Ananta (the immortal Sesa, the Serpent-god) and when Your trance came to an end—sprang
up, like a banyan tree froma tiny seed, a huge lotus that had lain hidden in You (till then).(33)
Sprung from that lotus, Brahma (the seer)—who failed to perceive anything other than that,
and thought You, the seed, though pervading himself, to be outside his body—could not
discover You, although he kept diving into the water for a hundred (celestial) years. Oh! how,
on a sprout having shot forth, could one get at the seed ? (34) Utterly amazed (at not finding
You) and perched on the lotus (once more), Brahma (the self-born), whose heart had been
thoroughly purified in course of time through intense meditation, eventually discovered You,
O Lord, in a most subtle form as pervading his own being—consisting of the (five gross)
elements, the (ten) Indriyas (the five senses of perception and the five organs of action) and
the inner sense—even as a Yogi would perceive the most subtle odour pervading the
earth.(35) Brahma (the creator) experienced (great) joy on seeing the Lord (in that subtle
form) and in the same way on beholding the Supreme Person (the Cosmic Being), a
manifestation of His own Maya (creative will), (who was) endowed with innumerable faces,
feet, heads, hands, thighs, noses, mouths, ears, eyes, omaments and weapons, (and) the
disposition of whose (different) limbs was symbolized by (the various spheres of) this (visible)
universe. (36) Assuming the form of Lord Hayagriva (who was endowed with a horse’s head)
and having slain the two mighty enemies of Veda, Madhu and Kaitabha by name, the
embodiments of Rajas and Tamas respectively, (who had snatched away the Vedas and
were bent upon killing Brahma,) You restored to Brahma the Vedic texts, (which are a symbol
of Sattva or enlightenment and which taught to him the means of pushing the work of
creation). (For) they declare Sattva to be Your most beloved body. (37) In this way You
protect the (different) worlds and destroy the enemies of creation through Your (numerous)
descents in the form of human beings (such as Sri Rama and Sri Balarama), beasts (such
as the divine Boar), seers (such as the sages Nara and Narayana), gods (such as Vamana,
the divine Dwarf), and the (divine) Fish, and maintain (the standards of) virtue prevalent in
