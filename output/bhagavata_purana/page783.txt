(sacred) fire and other sacrificial rites in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
sacred texts detailing such procedure, (16) Indeed the said almighty Lord, the enjoyer of all
sacrifices is not (so) fully propitiated by oblations offered through the (sacrificial) fire, O
Yudhisthira, as by offerings (in the shape of morsels of cooked food) dropped into the mouth
of a Brahmana (a member of the priestly class). (17) Therefore, worship the aforesaid Lord
(the Inner Controller of all) through the Brahmanas and the gods, as well as through other
human beings and other living creatures, (of course) after the Brahmanas, according to their
respective worth, through various objects of enjoyment. (18) A Dwija (a member of the twice-
born classes) possessed of the wherewithal should perform, in the (lunar) month of
Prausthapada (i.e., Bhadrapada, ifa monthis taken to commence with the bright fortnight,
or Agwina if it is taken to commence with the dark fortnight) according to his means, the
Sraddha pertaining to the dark fortnight (and known by the name of Mahalaya) in honour of
his (deceased) parents as well as of their relations and others. (19) He should (similarly)
perform their Sraddha at the time of the summer and winter solstices and the vernal and
autumnal equinoxes; during the particular (seventeenth) astronomical division of time called
Vyatipata; on the day when a Tithi (a lunar day begins and ends without one sunrise or
between two sunrises; during a lunar or solar eclipse; on a twelfth lunar day as well as during
the period when the constellations known by the name of Sravana, Dhanistha and Satabhisa
are ascendant; on the third (lunar day) of the bright half of Vaisakha as well as on the ninth
(lunar day) of the bright half of Kartika; on the four Astakas (the eighth lunar days of the dark
fortnight) during the seasons known by the name of Hemanta and Sigira (the months of
Margasirsa, Pausa, Magha and Phalguna); on the seventh (lunar day) of the bright fortnight
of the month of Magha; on the full-moon day (of Magha) when the constellation called Magha
is ascendant; (nay,) even when the constellations associated with (and accounting for the
names of) the (other) lunar months (also) appear on a full moon or even when the moon rises
one digit less than the full on that day; on any twelfth lunar day when (the constellations of)
Anuradha, Sravana and (any of) the three constellation associated with the name of Uttara
(namely, Uttara Phalguni., Uttarasadha and Uttara Bhadrapada) are ascendant; or when the
eleventh lunar day (of any month) is conjoined with (any of) these (constellations); (and
lastly) on any day when the constellation under which one was born or (the constellation of)
Sravana is ascendant. (20—23) These aforesaid periods are suitable (not only for Sraddha
but) for all virtuous acts to be performed by men inasmuch as they enhance to a large extent
the merit of the performer. One should practise virtue (in any form or shape) on (all) these
days with all one's being; (for) there lies the fruitfulness of one's life. (24) Ablution, Japa (the
muttering of prayers), Homa (offering oblations into the sacred fire), any sacred vow and
worship of the gods and the Brahmanas that may be undertaken, and any gift that may be
made to the manes, gods,human beings and (other) living beings on these occasions surely
become imperishable (bring everlasting good). (25) (Nay,) one should undertake such acts
of virtue (even) when the time comes for (the performance of) any purificatory rite for the
benefit of one's wife or son, nay, of one's own self, the cremation of a dead body and the death
anniversary of one's parents and others and (also) on the occasion of any (other) ceremony
intended to promote one’s welfare, O Yudhisthira ! (26)
