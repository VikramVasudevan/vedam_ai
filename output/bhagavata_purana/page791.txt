its object the destruction of an enemy, or that conducted by means of material substances,
such as Agnihotra (the daily offering of oblations into the sacred fire), as well as Darga.(a
fortnightly sacrifice performed on every AmAvasya, the last day of-a dark fortnight when the
sun and the moon dwell together) and Purnamasa (another fortnightly sacrifice performed
on the full moon), Caturmasya (one of the three sacrifices performed at the beginning of
every four months), an animal sacrifice, a Soma sacrifice, Vaiswadeva (a rite which must be
performed by every householder both morning and evening and especially before the
midday meal and consists in homage paid to the Viswedevas) and even so Balikarma
(offering, before the daily meal, morsels of cooked food such as rice, bread etc., to certain
gods, semi-divine beings, household divinities, spirits, men, birds, other animals and all
creatures including even lifeless objects)—(collectively) known as Ista (sacrificial acts)—
and Purta (works of public utility) such as the construction of a temple, a garden, a well or
a place where water is supplied to wayfarers, cattle and so on—(both) these are designated
as Pravrtta Karma, if they are undertaken from interested motives, and bring uneasiness (of
mind) in their train (accompanied as they are by excessive attachment). (48-49) The subtle
modification of material substances (thrown into the fire as oblations, and entering into the
constitution of an ethereal body), (the deities presiding over) smoke, the night-time, the dark
fortnight, the winter half-year (representing the sun's progress south of the equator) and (the
sphere of) the moon, (which mark the gradual ascent of the departed soul, and dissolution
of the ethereal body (as illustrated by Amavasya, when the moon altogether ceases to
appear), annual plants and creepers, foodgrains and vital fluid (which mark its gradual
descent)—these, O ruler of the earth, make the path* of Pravrtta Karma (known by the name
ee Ee eee
* The idea is that the soul of one devoted to Pravrtta Karma here is invested after death with an ethereal body made
up of the subtle modifications of material substances thrown by him during his lifetime as oblations into the sacred fire; and,
united with this body, the soul gradually ascends to the sphere of the moon, being escorted on the way one after another by
the deities presiding over smoke, the night-time, the dark fortnight and the winter half-year. Having enjoyed the pleasures of
the moon-world (which is a part of heaven) and thus exhausted the merit responsible for its stay there, the soul takes a
downward course. As the soul falls from heaven, the ethereal body with which it was clothed in heaven gets dissolved even
as the orb of the moon ceases to be visible onan Amavasya. Descending on earth with a rain-drdp, it enters an annual plant
or creeper and appears in the form of a grain. Then, finding its way and getting absorbed into the system of a male human
being, itis transformed by stages into the generative fluid, which, on entering the uterus and getting united with the ovum during
the process of conceptionis gradually developed into a male or female embryo. This process of ascentand descent of ahuman
soul devoted to Pravrtta Karma has been oullined in the verses translated above and is corroborated by: the following Sruti
text :—

Bay इमं ग्राम इष्टापूर्ते दत्तमित्युपासते ते धूममभिसम्भवन्ति धूमाद्रात्रि: रात्रेरपरपक्षमपरपक्षाद्यान्षड् दक्षिणैति मासा स्तान्नैते संवत्सरमभिप्राप्नुवन्ति॥ ३॥

मासेभ्य: पितॄलोकं पित्तृलोकादाकाशमाकाशच्चन्द्रमसमेष सोमो राजा तद्देवानामन्नं तं देवा भक्षवन्ति॥४॥

तस्मिन्यावत्संपात्तमुषित्वाथैतमेवाध्वानं पुनर्निवर्तन्ते यथेतमाकाशमाकाशाद्वायुं वायुर्भूत्वा धूमो भवति धूमो भूत्वाभ्रं water ५॥

ad yen मेघो भवति मेघो भूत्वा प्रवर्षति त इह व्रोहियवा ओषधिवनस्पतयस्तिलमाषा इति जायन्तेऽतो वै खलु दुर्निष्प्रपतरं यो यो ह्यत्रमत्ति यो रेत:
सिञ्चति तद्भूय एव भवति॥ ६॥ (Chandogya Upanisad V. x. 3-6)

Also compare the following verse of the Bhagavadgita:—

धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्ण: षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्। तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य Fada

The other path is that in which are stationed the gods presiding over smoke, night, the dark fortnight and thesix months
of the southward course of the sun; the Yogi (devoted to action with an interested motive ana) taking to this path, after death,

isled by the above-said gods, one after another, and attaining to the lustre (region) of the moon (and enjoying the fruit of his
meritorious deeds in heaven) returns to this mortal world.
