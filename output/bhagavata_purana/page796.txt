Sri Suka went on: Hearing the discourse of the celestial sage (Narada) as reproduced
in the foregoing verses, Emperor Yudhisthira (the foremost of the Bharatas) felt much
delighted and, overwhelmed with love, (duly) worshipped him as well as Sri Krsna (who was
present there). (78) Taking leave of Sri Krsna and Yudhisthira (son of Prtha) and honoured
by them, the (celestial) sage left (for his abode). (And) Yudhisthira felt highly amazed to hear
of Sri Krsna as (no other than) the supreme Reality. (79) In this way | have related to you
separately the accounts of the posterity of the daughters of Daksa in which are comprised
(the various) orders of animate and inanimate creation, such as gods, demons and human
beings. (80)

Thus ends the fifteenth discourse entitled "An inquiry into right conduct (concluded)", forming
part of the dialogue between Emperor Yudhisthira and the sage Narada, narrating
the story of Prahrada, in Book Seven of the great and glorious Bhagavata-Purana,
otherwise known as the Paramahamsa-Samnhita, composed by the sage
Vedavyasa and consisting of eighteen thousand Slokas.
