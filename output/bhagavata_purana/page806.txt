The king of elephants (mentally) prayed: We mentally offer (our) salutation to that
all-powerful supreme Lord—denoted by the mystical syllable Orn—because of whom
(animated by whom) this (psycho-physical) organism appears as conscious and who enters
the (various) bodies (as their causes) in the shape of Prakrti (primordial Matter) and Purusa
(the Spirit). (2) | (mentally) approach(for protection) that self- existent Lordin whom (asits ground)
this universe rests, from whom it has emanated, by whom and by whose instrumentality it is
brought into existence, (nay,) who Himself constitutes this universe, and (yet) who is beyond
this phenomenal existence as well as its unmanifest Cause (Prakrti).(3) May that
self-revealed Lord protect me—He who transcends (reveals) even the revealing agencies
(the eye, mind and so on), and who because of His unobstructed vision regards as a
(disinterested) witness this aforesaid universe, projected (evolved) in His own Self by His
creative energy, both when sometimes (at the time of creation) it becomes manifest, and
when at other times it likewise gets screened from view (at the time of dissolution being
merged in Prakrti). (4) (At the time of final dissolution) when (all) the (fourteen)* spheres and
(the bodies of) their guardians ( Brahma and others) are reducedto the state of (their causes,)
the five (gross) elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) and all the causes (viz., the five
gross elements, the five subtle elements, the five senses of perception, the five organs of
action, the mind, the ego and the Mahat-tattva or the principle of Cosmic Intelligence) get
dissolved (into their ultimate Cause, Prakrti or primordial Matter) by lapse of time (to the
extent of two Parardhas, the lifetime of a Brahma), impenetrable (incomprehensible) and
fathomless darkness (ignorance in the shape of the Unmanifest) prevails at that time. May
that all-pervading Lord protect me, who sheds His lustre all round (even) beyond that
darkness, nay, whose reality (even) gods and seers cannot comprehend—any more than
an ordinary spectator can discover the identity of an actor acting differently in diverse
appearances—much less can any(other ordinary and ignorant) creature know or describe
it, His course of conduct being hard to fathom.(5-6) He alone is my refuge, whose most
auspicious nature (even) contemplative souls that have completely shaken off (all)
attachment and are identified with, and benevolently disposed towards, (all) created beings
and exceedingly pious (in character) are eager to perceive, for which they scrupulously
observe in the woods (away from the bustle of worldly life) sacred vows(of continence etc.),
beyond the capacity of ordinary people. (7) Hail, hail to that all perfect supreme Lord of infinite
potencies and wonderful activity, devoid of form, yet possessed of innumerable forms, for
whom there is neither birth (brought about by past Karma) nor actions(inspired by the sense
of doership), neither name nor form (when He is conceived of as devoid of attributes), and
