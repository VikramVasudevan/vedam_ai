being entirely free from attachment to the objects of senses, is (consequently) unattainable
by those attached to their body, children, friends, house, wealthand kinsmen and Who, being
consciousness itself, is constantly contemplated upon by emancipated souls in their own
heart.(18) May that Lord of unbounded mercy bring about my complete deliverance (fromthe
clutches of this monster as well as from the bondage of worldly existence), by worshipping
Whom those seeking religious merit, objects of sensuous enjoyment, (worldly) riches and
final beatitude attain their desired goal, nay, Who grants them other (unexpected) boons
(too) as well as an undecaying (divine) body (in which they sport with Him). (19) | glorify that
imperishable, all-pervading, (most) subtle (mysterious), infinite and absolutely perfect
Supreme, the (very) First principle, the Ruler(even) of the greatest (Brahma, Siva andso On),
Who, though unmanifest (to those who donot worship Him) is attainable (by His worshippers)
through Yoga (concentration of mind) directed towards the supreme Spirit (Himself), Who
is beyond the(range of the material) senses and (though near at hand, being our very self)
appears as though exceedingly remote (being veiled by His deluding potency), and from
whom people exclusively devoted to Him, (nay,) even those who have sought shelter in the
Lord do not seek any boon (in the shape of religious merit and so On), but are immersed in
an ocean of bliss while singing His most marvellous and highly auspicious stories.(20-21)

The Lord by whose minutest ray (all) the gods with Brahmaas their head, the (four) Vedas
and (both) the animate and inanimate worlds have been created with an infinite variety of
names and forms and from whom, the self-luminous One, this phenomenal world—which
is(nothing but) a modification of the three Gunas, consisting as it does of the intellect, the
mind, the (ten) Indriyas (the five senses of perception and the five organs of action), the
bodies with which a Jiva is invested in the course of its mundane existence—emanates and
into Whom it returns in the same way as flames emanate again and again from fire and rays
from the sun, and then return (into the fire and the sun respectively)—that Lord is, really
speaking, neither a god nor a demon nor a human being nor again an animal: He is neither
a female nor a male nor a person of neither sex nor is He an asexual creature, He is neither
an attribute noran action, neitheran effect nora cause. Heis that which remains (as the basis
of negation) after everything else has been negated, and (yet) constitutes all. May He reveal
Himself (for bringing about my release) ! (22—24) | do not long to survive (by being extricated

from the grip of this alligator); what have | to do here (in this mortal world) with this elephant-
