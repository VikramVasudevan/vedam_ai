On the ocean being churned, the aforesaid mountain( Mount Mandara), which had

nothing to support it, sank into the ocean due to its (heavy) weight, even though it was held
by the mighty gods and Asuras, O scion of Pandu ! (6) Their effort having been frustrated by
a much more powerful destiny, they felt much dejected at heart and their faces too grew
pale.(7) Perceiving (behind this setback) the hand of Vighnega (the god ruling over the
agencies that interrupt ambitious undertakings), and assuming the wonderful and gigantic
form of a tortoise, the Lord of unlimited prowess and unfailing resolve then plunged into the
water (of the ocean) and bore up the mountain.(8) On seeing the great mountain rising, the-
gods and the demons girded their loins once more to proceed with the churning. Like another
great division of the globe, the Lord (in the form of a tortoise) bore the mountain on His back,
which was one lakh Yojanas or 8,00,000 miles in extent. (9) Supporting on His back, O dear
Pariksit, the mountain shaken by the might of arms of the principal gods and demons and
(consequently) set revolving, the infinite Lord, manifested as the First Tortoise regarded its
revolution as the (mere) scratching of His back. (10) Stimulating the strength and energy of
the demons, Visnu (the all-pervading Lord) entered the demons in His demoniac aspect
(Rajasika nature); and animating the hosts of gods, He entered the divinities in His godly
aspect (Sattvika character). (Again,) He entered Vasuki (the king of serpents) in the form of
Suspended consciousness (so as to deaden him to the pain that he would have otherwise
feltas a result of his being pulledand rubbed against the rugged surface of the mountain).(11)
Pressing Mount Mandara (the chief of the mountains) with one hand (in order to prevent the
mountain from springing up), the Lord, who was endowed with a thousand arms, stood on
its summit, like another huge mountain, under a shower of flowers by gods headed by
Brahma, Lord Siva and Indra (the lord of paradise) singing His praises in heaven. (12)
Strengthened by the Supreme—as pressing the mountain from above (in His thousand-
armed form) and supporting it below (in the form of a huge tortoise) and entering the body
of the gods and the demons (in the form of His Sattvika and Rajasika nature), the mountain
(in the form of stubbornness), and the serpent (in the form of suspended consciousness)—
and intoxicated with pride, the gods and the demons began to.churn the ocean with the help
of the great mountain (Mandara) with such violence as tocausea (great) stiramong the hosts
of crocodiles (and other aquatic creatures living in the ocean).(13) With their brightness
marred by the breath, fire and smoke issuing from the thousand fearful eyes and mouths of
Vasuki (the king of serpents), the demons, headed by the Paulomas and Kaleyas, Bali and
Ilwala, looked like (a row of) Sarala (a species of) trees scorched by a forest conflagration.(14)
On the gods, however—whose splendour had been obscured by his flaming breaths
and whose raiment, excellent wreaths of flowers, coats and faces had been soiled with
smoke-clouds under the (direct) command of the Lord poured down copious showers,and
breezes moistened by the waves of the ocean fanned them.(15)
