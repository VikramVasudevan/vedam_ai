The king (Pariksit) submitted : The accounts of all the (six) Manvantaras (divisions of
a Kalpa or day of Brahma, presided over by a Manu), as well as of the heroic deeds
performedin them by Sri Hari ofunlimited prowess have been heard byme as told by you.(1)
| have (further) heard from you that the same royal sage, Satyavrata byname, the (then) ruler
of the Dravida territory (in South India), who attained spiritual enlightenment through
devotion to Sri Hari (the supreme Person) at the end of the previous Kalpa was, born as
(Sraddhadeva) a son of Vivaswan (the sun-god) and became Manu (in the present
Manvantara). The names of his sons, Ikswaku and other kings, told by you, have also been
heard. (2-3) To us, who are indeed ever eager to hear you, O holy Brahmana, (pray,) narrate
their line 88 well as the doings of those belonging to that line, O highly blessed one ! (4)
(Kindly) recount to us the deeds of valour of all those kings of sacred renown—those who
have gone by, those who will follow and those who are ruling at present. (5)
