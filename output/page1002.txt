968 YAJURVEDA

Asyedindro vavrdhe vrsnyam Savo made sutasya
visnavi. Adya tamasya mahimanamayavo’
nustuvanti purvatha. Ima utva. Yasyayam. Ayain
sahasram. urdhva’iu su nah.

In the rapture of soma distilled in this world of
Lord Vishnu’s yajna of creation, Indra, lord of power
and grandeur, strengthens the vitality and virility of this
devotee.

And that generosity of this Indra all the devotees
celebrate to-day as the ancients did of old.

These celebrations exalt you only. Yours is the
glory. The lord promotes a hundred yajnas. He is up on
high over us all.
