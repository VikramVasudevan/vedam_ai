972 YAJURVEDA

In truth I celebrate food and energy, might and
majesty, justice and piety, and power and splendour,
by the force of which Indra, saviour in all three phases
of time, destroys the otherwise invulnerable Vritra,
demon of darkness, want and sin.

8.  (Anumati Devata, Agastya Rshi)

अन्विर्दनुमते त्वं wane ot ot नस्क्वृधि ।
क्रत्वे दक्षाय नो हिनु प्र णऽआर्यूश्डैषि तारिष:॥८॥

Anvidanumate tvam manyasai sam ca naskrdhi.

Anumati, spirit and power of agreeability,
common consent and assent, whatever you approve, and
whatever you agree is good, give us that, do that for us.
Help us grow in intelligence and expertise for good
action. Help us all cross the seas of life with success.

9. (Anumati Devata, Agastya Rshi)

aM aseadutada ead मन्यताम् |
अग्निश्चं हव्यवार्हनो भर्वतं दाशुषे मर्य:॥९॥

Anu no’dyanumatiryajnam devesu manyatam.
Agnisca havyavahano bhavatam dasuse mayah.
May Anumati, spirit of consent and common will,
have our yajna of positive action accepted among the
noblest people, and may both the common will and Agni,
brilliant leader and carrier of oblations and investments
to the heights of success, be good and generous to the
contributive participant in the corporate yajna of life.

10. (Sinivali Devata, Gritsamada Rshi)
