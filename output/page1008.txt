CHAPTER-XXXIV 973

Sinivali prthustuke ya devanamasi svasd.
Jusasva havyamahutam prajam devi dididdhi
nah.

Lady of love and loyalty, virgin beauty of fertility,
brilliant and pious, sister of the learned, accept the holy
offer of marriage, take the hand of the noble groom
invited, enjoy life, and give us the gift of lovely children.

11. (Sarasvati Devata, Gritsamada Rshi)
usd नद्यु: सरंस्वतीमर्पियन्ति cetera: |
सरस्वती तु र्पञ्चधा सो देशेऽर्भवत्सरित् ॥११॥

Panca nadyah sarasvatimapi yanti sasrotasah.
Sarasvati tu pancadha so dese’ bhavatsarit.

Five streams of sense experience with their perceptions
flow into the one Sarasvati of the mind, and then the
mind, converting the experience into language, flows
out in five streams of expression.

(This is the Vedic triangle of Shabda, Artha and
Pratyaya, that is, the semantic triangle of language,
reality and meaning, which is the mental association of
word and object in an integrated mental picture. The
mantra also draws the full circle of experience,
interpretation and expression for communication of the
experience. The central interpretive role is played by
the soul through its consciousness, chetana, which is
its essential property, senses and mind being its
instruments. )

12. (Agni Devata, Hiranyastupa Angirasa Rshi)
त्वर्मग्ने प्रथमोऽअङ्गिराऽऋषिर्देवो देवार्नामभव: yea:
wat । ad aa कवयों विद्मनापसोऽर्जायन्त मरुतो
