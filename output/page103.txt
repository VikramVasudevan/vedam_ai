70 YAJURVEDA

all these with oblations of appropriate samagri materials
with the chants of the divine revelations of the Vedas.

8. (Ishvara Devata, Atreya Rshi)

favalt देवस्यं नेतुर्मर्तो` atta सख्यम् |
fasat रायऽईषुध्यति द्युम्नं र्वृणीत पुष्यसे caret ue

Visvo devasya neturmarto vurita sakhyam. Visvo
raya’ isudhyati dyumnam vrnita pusyase svaha.

May all mankind choose and pray for the love
and friendship of the Lord and Ruler of the world, and
may all, with prayers to Him, try for the attainment of
wealth and prosperity for health and growth.

9. (Vidvan Devata, Angiras Rshi)

ऋॠक्सामयो: Bred स्थस्ते वामारभे a at पातमास्य
यज्ञस्योदूर्च:। शर्मीसि ort मे aes नर्मस्तेऽअस्तु मा ut
fava: ॥९॥

Rksamayoh Silpe sthaste vamarabhe te ma
patamasya yajnasyodrcah. Sarmasi Sarma me
yaccha namaste’ astu ma ma himsth.

After the study of Rigveda and Samaveda, both
treasures of science and technology, in which study the
content of the verses is actually realized, I begin this
practical yajna of science and technology (in the
laboratory and the workshop). May the two protect me
and bless me. Reverence and salutations to you, to the
teacher, to the Lord. Accept my salutations. Hurt me
not, put me not off. You are peace and comfort. Give
me peace and comfort of mind.
