1002 YAJURVEDA

Agni, lord giver of life, you purify and sanctify
the long years of our life. We pray, create and promote
food, energy and the light of knowledge for us, and
throw off all evil and violence far from us.

17. (Agni Devata, Vaikhanasa Rshi)

स्वार्हा ॥१७॥

Ayusmdanagne havisa vrdhano ghrtapratiko
ghrtayoniredhi. Ghrtam pitva madhu caru
gavyam piteva putramabhi raksatadimantsvaha.

Agni, long-lived ruler of power and light,
growing by fragrant offerings, manifesting in the rising
flames of ghrta, abiding in ghrta, come and, having
drunk of ghee and the honey-sweet delicious products
of the cow, protect and promote these dedicated souls
as father protects the children.

This is the voice of the heart in truth of word and
deed.

18. (Indra Devata, Bharadvaja Shirambitha Rshi)

परीमे गार्मनेषत पर्यग्निर्महृषत |
eased श्रव: कऽड्माँ२॥ऽआ र्दधर्षति ॥१८॥

Parime gamanesata paryagnimahrsata.
Devesvakrata Ssravah ka’iman’a dadharsati.

All these, you all, protect and promote the cow,
raise the holy voice of knowledge, preserve and
replenish the earth, expand the fire of yajna, and feed
the divinities of nature and the environment, and who
can dare to challenge you ? None!
