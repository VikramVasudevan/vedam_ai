CHAPTER-XXXVI

1. (Agni Devata, Dadhyang-atharvana Rshi)
wa वाचं प्र पद्ये मनो यजु: प्र र्पद्ये ATH प्राणं प्र र्पद्ये चक्षु:
श्रोत्रं प्रर्पद्ये । वागोर्ज: सहौजो aft प्राणापानौ ue

Ream vacam pra padye mano yajuh pra padye
sama pranam pra padye caksuh srotram pra
padye. Vagojah sahaujo mayi pranapanau.

I arise and come to Rigveda, voice of Divinity. I
come to Yajurveda, mind and resolution divine. I come
to Samaveda, energy and ecstasy divine. I come to
Atharva-veda, vision and vibration of Divinity. That
speech is my light and glory. That light and mind is my
strength and spirit of courage and fortitude. By virtue
of the divine, the prana and apana energy is my real
might.

2. (Brihaspati Devata, Dadhyang-atharvana Rshi)

तर्द्दधातु । शां नों भवतु भुर्वनस्य यस्पर्ति: ॥२॥

Yanme chidram caksuso hrdayasya manaso
vatitrnnam brhaspatirme taddadhatu. Sam no
bhavatu bhuvansya yaspatih.

Whatever the weakness of my eye, of my heart,
and of my mind, whatever the loop-holes anywhere, may
the Lord of Infinity make up and re-fill. May the lord
who is father and guardian of the universe, we pray, be
good and gracious to us.
