CHAPTER-XXXVI 1011

Women, cool and blessed like heavenly waters,
as you arise for the peace and bliss of the home of the
man you love, we would provide for the joy and comfort
of him and for you too. And you too create and generate
joy and bliss for us.

May the heavens bring us peace. May peace be
with the skies, and may the skies shower us with peace.
May there be peace on earth, and may the earth mother
bring us peace. May there be peace with the waters,
and may the waters bring us peace. May there be peace
in the herbs, and may the herbs bring us peace. May
peace be with the trees and may the trees bring us peace.
Peace be with the divinities of the world, and may they
bless us with peace. May the Great Lord of the universe
bless us with peace, and may the Veda inspire us with
peace. May all existence be at peace and may peace
come from all existence to all. May there be peace only,
universal peace for all. May that heavenly peace come
and bless me. May It bless all.
