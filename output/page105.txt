72 YAJURVEDA

Vratam krnutagnirbrahmagniryajno vanaspatir-
yajniyah. Daivim dhiyam manamahe
sumrdikamabhistaye varcodham yajnavahasam
sutirtha no’asadvase. Ye deva manojata
manoyujo daksakratavaste no’vantu te nah
pantu tebhyah svaha.

Keep the vow of yajnagni, the fire of yajna. Agni
is Brahma, the ultimate existent, omniscient, blissful
Reality. Agni is yajna, individual, collective and
ultimate act of creation. Agni is the nourishing and
sustaining power of the forests, and must be served
through yajna. We work and pray for sacred intelligence
— excellent instrument of the knowledge and pursuit
of science and spirituality, source of brilliance and
power and the means of the extension and development
of yajna — for the sake of happiness and well-being.
May this intelligence, bright and gracious, saviour as a
‘tirtha’ for pilgrimage, ever shine in our mind and faith.
May the masters of the science of yajna, men of genius,
dedication and application of mind protect us, nourish
us, advance us. Theirs is the language of enlightenment.
They have it for us, for yajna, for Agni, for Brahma.
Keep up the vow.
