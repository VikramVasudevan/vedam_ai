CHAPTER-XXXVII 1023

lord sustainer of the world, bless me with health and
wealth.

Mother of constancy, from above, under the rule
and supremacy of Brihaspati, bless me with the light
and lustre of life.

You are the Queen omnipresent in the heart and
mind, protect me from the defilement and pollutions of
the world.

13. (Vidvans Devata, Dadhyangatharvana Rshi)
स्वाहां मरुद्भि: परिंश्रीयस्व fea: ax स्पृशंस्पाहि |
मधु मधु wel ॥१३॥

Svaha marudbhih pari Sriyasva divah
samsprsaspahi. Madhu madhu madhu.

Man of knowledge, with truth of word and deed,
shine as a flame with the children of the earth, mix with
them and provide all round sustenance. Save the earth
from the scorching blaze of the sun. May knowledge
be holy sweet. May karma be honey-sweet. May worship
be heavenly sweet. May life be honey-sweet.

14. (Ishvara Devata, Dadhyangatharvana Rshi)
गर्भो` देवार्नो पिता र्मतीनां पर्ति: प्रजार्नाम् 1
सं देवो देवेर्न सवित्रा र्गत as Gaur रोचते ॥१४॥

Garbho devanam pita matinam patih prajanam.
Sam devo devena savitrad gata sam suryena
rocate.

The Origin of divinities, father of the wise,
sustainer of His children, light of the universe, pervading
the brilliant sun, giver of light and sustainer of life, the
Lord shines all over, self-manifested. Know Him, be
with Him, go with Him.
