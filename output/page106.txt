CHAPTER-IV 73

Taste and drink deep of the celestial waters of
immortality, so sweet and agreeable to assimilate and
internalize. Free from sickness, disease and sin, peace-
giving and replete with knowledge and wisdom for all
of us, they extend the frontiers of our knowledge of
truth and divine law. They protect you against diseases
like fever, dysentery and tuberculosis.

13. (Apah Devata, Angiras Rshi)

ga ¢ यज्ञियाँ तनूरपो deen न प्रजाम् । अश्होमुच:
स्वार्हाक्कृता: पृथिवीमारविंशत पृथिव्या aes ॥१३॥

Iyam te yajniya tanurapo muncami na prajam.
Amhomucah svahakrtah prthivimavisata
prthivya sambhava.

This body of yours is for yajna by yajna. I release
the waters but not my creation and my people — I save
my people. Mix the waters — sterilized, purified,
reinforced, invigorated — wholly and fully with the
earth, and you too be one with the earth (to regain health
and vigour).

14. (Agni Devata, Angiras Rshi)
अग्ने wax सु जागृहि aax सु मन्दिषीमहि ।
tat णोऽअप्रंयुच्छन् wat न: पुर्नस्कृथि ues
Agne tvam su jagrhi vayam sumandisimahi.

Raksa no’ aprayucchan prabudhe nah
punaskrdhi.

Agni is universal, ever awake. It is awake while
we are awake. It is awake while we are asleep. Never
relenting, it protects and preserves us. And after our
sleep it wakes us up again.
