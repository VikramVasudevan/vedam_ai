CHAPTER-XXXVIII 1027

Pita no’si pita no bodhi namaste’astu ma ma
himsth. Tvastrmantastva sapema putran pasun
mayi dhehi prajamasmasu dhehyarista’ hain
saha patya bhuyasam.

You are our father. As father, enlighten us.
Homage and worship to you. Pray injure me not. Lord
maker of the world, we are your children blest with
brilliant gifts, and we wish to be with you. Bless us
with children and animal wealth. Bless us with a noble
community, I pray, unhurt and untarnished, I may
always abide by you, my lord and protector.

Ahah ketuna jusatam sujyotirjyotisa svaha.
Ratrih ketuna jusatain sujyotirjyotisa svaha.

May the day, our wakeful state of the soul, join
with knowledge, and may the light of our knowledge
join with the light divine in truth of word and deed.

May the night, our dream-and-sleep state of the
mind, join with knowledge, and may the light of
knowledge join with the light divine in truth of word
and deed.
