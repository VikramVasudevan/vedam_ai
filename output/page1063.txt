1. (Savita Devata, Atharvana Rshi)

आददेऽर्दित्यै रास्नांऽसि ॥१॥

Devasya tva savituh prasave ’Ssvinorbahubhyam
pusno hastabhyam. A dade’dityai rasna’ si.

In the yajnic creation of Savita, universal creator
and progenitor, I take you unto me with the procreative
powers of the Ashvins, sun and moon, and the sustaining
powers of Pusha, the wind. You are the generous and
gracious power of Mother Nature’s fertility for
expansive growth and freedom.

Ida’ ehyadita’ehi sarasvatyehi. Asavehyasave
hyasavehi.

Come Ida, voice divine. Come Aditi, mother of
fertility. Come Sarasvati, mother of knowledge and spirit
of life’s onward flow.

And come he who seeks the voice divine, who
seeks generation and sacred growth, and who seeks
knowledge and progress.
