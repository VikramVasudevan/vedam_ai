1036 YAJURVEDA

Homage to Rudra who rallies and calls up the
Rudra prana energy (for the destruction of evil). The
light of the world joins with the light of the universe.

May the day with its lustre, beautiful light, join
with the light divine. Homage to this communion.

May the night with its beauty, soothing grace, join
with the grace divine. Salutations to this communion.

Lord of the universe, cosmic yajna, grant us a taste
of the celestial honey sweets offered into the mightiest
fire of cosmic yajna. Salutations to you!

Mighty Rudra, lord of pranic energy, lord of
justice and reckoning, pray injure us not.

Agni, inspired and expansive, this grandeur of

yours predominates the heaven and fills this earth with
fame.

Great you are indeed, most pleasing and blissful
to the divinities. Pray be settled in the vedi and shine.

Agni, lord admirable, pray create the red flames
of divine beauty (and fragrance from the vedi).
