1038 YAJURVEDA

Kstrasya tva paraspaya brahmanastanvam pahi.
Visastva dharmana vayamanu kramama
suvitaya navyase.

Ruler of the land, for the protection of the people
and advancement of the nation, protect and promote
the Brahmana body of education and research. Protect
and strengthen the Kshatra body of defence and
administration. And all the people and we too support
and follow you as a matter of discipline and Raja-
Dharma for the achievement of new and newer forms
of wealth and well-being.

20. (Yajna Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

SAA ॥२०॥

Catuhsraktirnabhirrtasya saprathah sa no
visvayuh saprathah sa nah sarvayuh saprathah.
Apa dveso’apa hvaro’nyavratasya sascima.
Ruler, head of the national yajna of governance
and administration, well-armed you are all round in the
four directions. Centre-hold of the law and the body-
politic, you are expansive (omnipresent, as if, through
the system). Universally popular, may you attain to full
age to protect and promote us. Celebrated head of
universal development and friend of all, may you live a
full age of dignity for us. We reject hate and hostility,
crooked opposition and those committed to contrary
values.

घर्मैतत्ते ate तेन वर्द्धस्व चा ot प्यायस्व |
वद्भिषीमहि च agar dt प्यासिषीमहि ॥२१॥
