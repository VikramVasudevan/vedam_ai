CHAPTER-XXXVIII 1039

Gharmaitatte puritsam tena vardhasva ca ca
Pyayasva. Vardhisimahi ca vayama ca
Pyasisimahi.

Dharma, brilliant ruler and high-priest of this
blazing yajna, this nation and this yajna is the measure
of your power and potential. Grow by it and attain to
your full stature. And may we too grow by it and rise to
our full national honour and glory.

22. (Yajna Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

अर्चिक्रदद् वृषा हरिर्महान् मित्रो न agia: |
सश्सूर्येण दिद्युतदुदधिर्निधि: ॥1२२॥

Acikradad vrsa harirmahan mitro na darsatah.
Sam suryena didyutadudadhirnidhih.

Agni, brilliant light of cosmic yajna, roaring with
thunder, showering with the clouds, shooting as
lightning, great and glorious, universal friend, bright
and beautiful, and blazing with the sun 1s a jewel treasure
of wealth deep as the oceans of space.

23. (Apah Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

सुमित्रिया न ऽआपऽआऒओर्षधय: सन्तु दुर्मित्रियास्तस्मैं
सन्तु स्रोऽस्मान् द्वेष्टि यं चं ad द्विष्म: ॥२३॥

Sumitriya na’apa’osadhayah santu durmi-
triyastasmai santu yo’sman dvesti yam ca vayam
dvismah.

May the herbs and waters and the pranic energies
they bear be efficacious as good friends to us, and may
they carry strong antidotes for those negativities that
injure us and which we hate to suffer.
