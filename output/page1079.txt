is for purification through the fire.

3. (Vak etc. Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

ara स्वाहां प्राणाय स्वाहां प्राणाय स्वाहां 1 aad
स्वाहा VAY स्वाहा strata स्वाहा strata carat ॥३॥

Vace svaha pranaya svaha pranaya svaha.
Caksuse svaha caksuse svaha Srotraya svaha
Srotraya svaha.

This oblation is for speech and its purity, this is
for the breath of one nostril, this is for the breath of the
other, this is for the sight of one eye, this is for the sight
of the other, this is for the hearing by one ear, this is for
the other.

4. (Shri Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

मर्नस: carat वाच: सत्यर्मशीय | ugMresaraea
Tat ast: sit: staat मयि carat ॥४॥

Manasah kamamakitim vacah satyamastya.
Pasunam rupamannasya raso yasah §srith
Srayatam mayi svaha.
May I get the sanctified will and resolution of
the mind. May I get the divine truth of speech. May I
beget the beautiful forms of living beings. May I get
the sweet vitality and taste of food. May all these and
honour, beauty and grace be vested in me in life again
and again.

This is the voice of the soul in truth of word and
deed.
