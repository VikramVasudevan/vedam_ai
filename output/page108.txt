CHAPTER-IV 75

Savita, Lord Creator of the world, giver of stability and
security of home, give us inspiration, security and
stability of the good life.

17. (Agni Devata, Vatsa Rshi)

wa d शुक्र तनूरेतद्वर्चस्तया ata भ्रार्जङ्गच्छ ।
जूरसि gat मर्नसा जुष्टा Fassia ॥१७॥

Esa te sukra tanuretadvarcastaya sambhava
bhrajamgaccha. Jurasi dhrta manasa justa
visnave.

O man, virile and brave, this body is yours, borne
with love and service and maintained for Vishnu,
sustainer of the world, and for yajna, noble action. It is
your honour and glory. Be with it, act with mind and
soul and achieve the glory of life. You are fast in action
and vibrant in spirit. Act fast with your mind and soul
and achieve the brilliance of knowledge and wonder of
succes in enterprise.

18. (Vak & Vidyut Devata, Vatsa Rshi)
तस्यांस्ते सत्यर्सवस: wee wat यन्त्र्मंशीय caret ।
शुक्रर्मसि चन्द्र्मस्यमूर्तमसि वैश्वदेवर्मसि ॥१८॥

Tasyaste satyasavasah prasave tanvo yantra-
mastya svaha. Sukramasi candramasyamrta-
masi vaisvadevamasi.

Lord Creator, true and glorious, in the yajna of
creation of yours, with electric energy and the divine
knowledge of the Veda in unison, I pray, I may design
an instrument and apparatus of the form and structure
which would be faultless and a source of comfort, peace
and happiness for all in general, and a matter of pride
and satisfaction for the scholars.
