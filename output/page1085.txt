1050 YAJURVEDA

Yamaya svaha’ntakaya svaha mrtyave svaha.
Brahmane svaha brahmahatyayai svaha
visvebhyo devebhyah svaha dyavaprthivibhyam
svaha.

In truth of word and deed and faith, homage to
Yama, lord of justice and reckoning. Homage to Antaka,
transcendent time that ends up everything in existence.
Homage to Death that consumes all that is born. Homage
to Brahma, the Supreme. Homage to the migration of
the soul. Homage to the divinities of existence. Homage
to Heaven and to Mother Earth.
