1052 YAJURVEDA

Asurya nama te loka’andhena tamasavrtah.
Tanste pretyapi gacchanti ye ke catmahano
janah.

Surely after death and even while living,
demonical souls sunk in darkness who kill their
conscience and live only a physical existence (void of
virtue) go to those sunless regions of the world which
are covered in the impenetrable darkness of sufferance.

4. (Brahma Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

अर्नेजदेकं मर्नसो weiter नैर्नद्देवाऽरआप्नुवन् पूर्वमर्ष`त् ।
तद्भार्वतोऽन्यानतत्येति तिष्ठत्तस्मिन्नपो मांतरिश्वां दधाति।४॥

Anejadekam manaso javiyo nainaddeva’
apnuvan purvamarsat. Taddhavato’nyanatyeti
tisthattasminnapo matarisva dadhdati.

Brahma is constant, unmoving, One and only
One, without a second, and faster than the mind. The
mind and senses cannot attain to It, although It is present
everywhere, already and always. Though still, It
surpasses and transcends others who are at the fastest
move in nature. Within It the wind holds the waters of
the universe. Within the Divine Presence the soul
performs its actions. (If somthing moves faster than the
velocity of light, it becomes omnipresent. And what is
omnipresent, is still too, because there is no space to
move through.)

5. (Atma Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)
