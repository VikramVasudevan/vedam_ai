76 YAJURVEDA

19. (Vak & Vidyut Devate, Vatsa Rshi)

fade मनासि धीरंसि दक्षिंणासि क्षत्रिर्यासि यज्ञियास्य-
दिंतिरस्युभयत: vio i सा न: सुप्रांची सुरप्रतीच्येधि
मित्रस्त्वां पदि र्बध्नीतां पूषाऽर्ध्वनस्पात्विन्द्रायार्ध्यक्षाय ॥१९॥

Cidasi manasi dhirasi daksinasi ksatriyasi
yajniyasyaditirasyubhayatah Ssirsni. Sa nah
supracti supraticyedhi mitrastva padi badhnitam
pusa’ dhvanaspatvindrayadhyaksaya.

Lord of truth and glory, in this creation of yours,
great is the use of the vision and power of the language
of Divinity, Veda, in the development of human society.
So is the use of the power of universal electric energy.
It gives us an awareness of knowledge, which makes
thought and communication possible. It is a tool and
instrument of intelligence and will. It facilitates
expertise and the business of governance. It augments
yajna and production, which is efficacious and powerful
both internally and externally. It is permanent and
indestructible, and a source and means of comfort and
well-being before and after. We pray that Pusha, the
powers of nourishment and development friendly to
mankind, may hold and control the use of these powers
in the way of their application in the service of the Lord
Supreme, observer and controller of the wealth of the
world, and may the Lord protect humanity in the course
of their progress.

art त्वा माता Harare पिताऽनु भ्राता STATS सखा
waa: । सा afta देवमच्छेहीन्द्राय सोर्मश्रुद्रस्त्वावर्त्तयतु
स्वस्ति सोमंसखा GRE ॥२०॥
