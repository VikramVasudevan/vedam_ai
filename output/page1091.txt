1056 YAJURVEDA

Different is the result of Vidya, they say, and
different is the result of Avidya, they say. This we have
heard from the wise who revealed the difference of both
to us.

14. (Atma Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)
विद्यां चविंद्यां च यस्तद्वेदोभर्यश्सह |
अविद्यया मृत्युं cdieat विद्ययामूर्तमश्नुते ॥१४॥

Vidyam cavidyam ca yastadvedobhayam saha.
Avidyaya mrtyum tirtva vidyaya’ mrtamasnute.

One who knows Vidya, 1.e., the constant reality
and the knowledge of it, and Avidya, 1.e., illusion, for
what it really is, and Karma including the order of
change, and knows that Supreme Spirit along with both
Vidya and Avidya, masters the reality and meaning of
death by Avidya, and realises Immortality by Vidya.

15. (Atma Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

SRA chal TAC | क्लिबे TAT । कृतशस्मर ॥१५॥

Vayuranilamamrtamathedam bhasmantaimn
Sariram. Om krato smara. Klibe smara. Krtain
smara.

The end of the body is ash. The prana-vayu
merges with the cosmic energy. And this soul is
immortal.

O soul, remember Om, Supreme Soul of
Existence. Agent of Karma, remember your karma.
Remember both these to realise your real form and
potential.
