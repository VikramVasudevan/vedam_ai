1058 YAJURVEDA

NOTE

Swami Dayananda has accepted this version of
Yajurveda chapter 40. There is another version, which
is also accepted as Ishopanishad, and that has eighteen
mantras. That version from mantra 15 to mantra 18 is
given below:

15. The face of truth is covered with a golden
veil (the veil of Prakrti). That veil, O Lord preserver
and promoter of life, unveil so that we may see the Truth
and eternal Dharma.

16. Lord giver of life and protection, universal
guide, eternal light, lord of creation, Sole Lord, one and
absolute, universal Eye, seer omniscient, gather up your
light for me. The splendour that is yours is the most
auspicious and sublime form I see. The light that shines
in the sun is the Purusha. That is there, That is in me.

17. The end of the body is ash. The breath of life
goes to eternal energy. The soul is immortal. O soul,
remember Om. Remember your karma. Lord of yajna,
agent of karma, remember the actions performed.

18. Agni, light of life, lead us on by the right path
to the wealth of life. Brilliant lord omniscient of all laws
and ways of existence, and all our thoughts and deeds,
remove from us all sin and crookedness. We sing songs
of celebration in praise of you. Homage to you again
and again
