CHAPTER-XL 1059

Shankaracharya, three works have been prominent. They
are: Vedanta Sutras, Upanishads, and the Gita. The three
together are known as Prasthana-trayi, and summed up
as ‘Vedanta’ in popular parlance. And Vedanta is
sometimes understood to be an ‘End of the Vedas’, a
‘take off? and even a substitute for the Vedas. For the
information of the dedicated readers it is important to
mention that:

1. The Vedanta Sutras are an extensive
commentary on the closing words of Yajurveda. The
closing words of Yajurveda are: Om Kham Brahma. And
the opening words of Vedanta Sutras are: Athato
Brahma Jijfiasa

Which means: And now, an enquiry into the
nature of Brahma. Clearly the Vedanta Sutras are an
extensive act of meditation on the open-ended close of
Yajurveda. Similarly Mandukyopanishad also is an
expansive act of meditation on OM, the first of the
closing words quoted above and Yajurveda (40, 15): Om
Krato Smara.

2. Chief among Upanishads for the common
reader are Ishopanishad and Mandukyopanishad.
Ishopanishad is a literal version of the closing chapter
of Yajurveda, and Mandukya, an act of meditation on
OM.

3. The Gita is a call to action, an extensive
commentary on the second mantra of the closing chapter
of Yajurveda:

Kurvanneveha karmani jijivisecchatam samah,

Evam tvayi nanyatheto’ sti na karma lipyate nare.
