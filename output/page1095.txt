1060 YAJURVEDA

Prasthana-trayi thus is neither the ‘End of the
Vedas’, nor a substitute, nor a take off. Each work is a
continuation of Vedic studies in its own context of
meditation, meditative teaching, and a rousing call to
action in a situation of karmic crisis.

The three are, thus, not a departure from the
Vedas, they are a homage to the Vedas.
