84 YAJURVEDA

32. (Agni Devata, Vatsa Rshi)

सूर्यस्य चक्षुरारोहाग्नेरक्ष्ण: कनीनंकम् ।
यत्रैर्तशेभिरीर्यसे भ्रार्जमानो विपङ्चितां ॥३२॥

Suryasya caksurarohagneraksnah kaninakam.
Yatraitasebhiriyase bhrajamano vipascita.

Ascend to the eye (light) of the sun, and enter into
the pupil of the eye of agni (light of fire) where, self-
illuminating with the rays of your light, you would be
approached and pursued by the discriminative scholar of
science.

33. (Surya & Vidvan Devata, Vatsa Rshi)

उस्त्रावेर्तं धूर्षाहौ युज्येर्थामनश्रूऽअवीरहणौ ब्रह्मचोर्दंनौ ।
स्वस्ति यजमानस्य गृहान् गच्छतम् ॥३३॥

Usravetam dhursahau yujyethamanasri’ avira-
hanau brahmacodanau. Svasti yajamanasya
grhan gacchatam.

Scholars dedicated to science and spirit in search
of the good life should commit themselves to the study
and application of the energy of the sun and vayu (wind
and electricity), both treasures of scientific power and
means of comfort, to be specifically investigated and
used just like two bullocks bearing the burdens for life’s
comfort to the house of the master without tears or hurt
to anybody but supporting the young and the brave. The
scholars also, for guidance, should reach the senior man
of knowledge who, too, silently bears the burdens of
life for the knowledge and comfort of others. Let the
joy and comfort of this scientific yajna, in consequence,
reach the home of the yajamana.
