36. (Surya Devata, Vatsa Rshi)
वरुंणस्योत्तम्भनमसि वरुंणस्य स्कम्भसर्जनी स्थो वरुंणस्यऽ
made वरुंणस्यऽऋतसर्दनमसि चरुंणस्यऽऋत-
सर्दनमासीदं ॥३६॥

ऎ>तापातऽ)४टाताईहतातातऽं varunasya skambha-
sarjani stho varunasya’ rtasadanyasi varunasya’
rtasadanamasi varunasya’ rtasadanamasida.

You are the bond and ultimate pillar of the
universe. You are the centre and sustenance of vayu’s
hold on things and the sun’s two-fold power to move
the waters in space. You are the mainstay of the world’s
phenomenal reality of Satyam and the seat and working
of Rtam, the universal law of Right and Truth. By your
grace only, we realize the meaning of existence and
follow the divine law of Dharma.

37. (Yajna Devata, Gotama Rshi)

या ते धार्मानि हविषा asta ता a favat परिभूरस्तु
यज्ञम् | गयस्फार्न: water: सुवीरोऽर्वीरहा प्ररचरा aa
at ॥३७॥

Ya te dhamani havisa yajanti ta te visva
paribhurastu yajnam. Gayasphanah prataranah
suviro’viraha pracara soma duryan.

Lord of the universe, whatever places are
sanctified by the performance of yajna with oblations
in your honour, all such places, O Soma, yajna may
grace and sanctify for us too — yajna, promoter of the
home, family and wealth, saviour from suffering, maker
of the brave, redeemer of the weak, all-round generous
and universal, may sanctify us too. Soma, scholar wise
and dedicated, go round, speak for, propagate and
perform yajna in every home.

इति चतुर्थोऽध्याय: ॥।
