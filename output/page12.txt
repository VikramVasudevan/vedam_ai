English Translation of Vedic Hymns: An Opinion

Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma has taken an uphill task of translating
all the four Vedas in lucid and thought provoking English. Most
of the translations of Vedas by European scholars depend on the
ritualistic meaning given by the medieval commentators like
Sayana and others. But Dr. Sharma has taken a new course of
translation. He agrees with the idea that the Yajurveda basically
propounds the theory of Karma which it explains as Yajna, which
neither denotes sacrifice nor mere ritual (Agnihotra etc.). The
term Yajna carries a threefold meaning: the worship of God,
unification of diverse factors of human society, selfless charity
and replenishment of nature and the environment.

The hymns of the Yajurveda carry lofty ideas of spiritual
and ethical significance. Most of these mantras are, however,
complicated and tough. It is difficult to make out useful meaning
and draw important conclusion out of the text. But Dr. Sharma
has fully succeeded in drawing out the natural and meaningful
content of these mantras. In brief I can say that the present
translation of the Vedas will be appreciated by the scholars of
this Vedic lore as well as by the lay man who wants to understand
the deep meaning of the Vedic texts or at least the basic knowledge
hidden in these ancient works. It is all the more satisfying that
Dr. Sharma has followed the dicta laid down by Maharshi Yaska
and Swami Dayananda Saraswati in translating and explaining
the inner wisdom of the sacred mantras.
