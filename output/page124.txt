Soma, Lord and spirit of life, power brilliant,
omnipresent in nature, master of unique knowledge and
promoter of wealth, nurture the growth bit by bit, wave
on wave, for the glory of Indra, the power of nature,
and may Indra, the power, grow for you, the spirit. And
may the seeker (the master and the disciple) grow for
the joy of life. Help us grow, help our friends and
comrades grow by virtue of your penetrating
intelligence. Let joy and comfort grow. May success
greet you! Man of brilliance dedicated to the spirit of
life, joining you in your creative efforts for the
production of food and energy, and the achievement of
honour and prosperity, may we obtain the wanted power
and wealth of life. To the speakers (and discoverers) of
the Law (of nature), knowledge (of truth and law)! To
earth and heaven, salutations (in gratefulness for fire
and light and growth)!
