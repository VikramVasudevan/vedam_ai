ध्रुव्रोऽसि पृथिवीं de ध्रुवक्षिर्दस्यन्तरिंक्षं दृश्हाच्युतक्षिदसि
fed दृश्हाग्ने: पुरींषमसि ॥१३॥

Yajna is firm and immovable, the centre of
movement. It develops the earth and enriches its wealth.
Develop yajna. It is the treasure-home of knowledge
and prosperity. It expands the sky and increases its
wealth and waters. Develop yajna. It is the seat of
indestructible wealth. It expands radiation of light and

of knowledge. It supplements and sharpens the powers
of nature. Develop yajna. Expand. Accelerate. Intensify.
It is the completion, the finale.
