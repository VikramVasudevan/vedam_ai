AUM

It has been gratifying to go through the English translation
of the Vedas rendered by Dr Tulsi Ram Sharma in as much as it
conveys to the English-knowing world effectively the profound
meaning and transcendental secrets enshrined in the Vedas. The
most salient feature of this translation is its simple and lucid
English. The Vedic words have been expounded here following
the yaugik method of the Arsh tradition set up by Yaska, Panini
and Patanjali (as opposed to the rudhi method which takes only
the historically fixed meanings of words caring little for the context
and the subject). As per the Arsh tradition name words like Agni,
Vayu, Indra, Marut, etc., are synonyms indicating the various
attributive names of the One that is the greatest and the most
comprehensive 'Tattva' of existence, the Cosmic Spirit. It was
Maharshi Dayananda who for the first time after Yaska and
Patanjali advocated and followed this principle of interpretation
on the basis of ancient supporting material. Dr. Sharma has
religiously stuck to this theory while unfolding the truths enshrined
in the Vedas. Obviously Dr Sharma's interpretation of Vedic
hymns enjoys the authenticity of the Arsh tradition and challenges
the western Vedic perspective and the medieval Indian
interpretations of the Vedas which now need to be seriously
reviewed in our present day context of science and inter-cultural
communication
