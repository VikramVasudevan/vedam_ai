power in the service of society. I know your faith and I
strengthen your faith and resolve. Yajna is holy, it is a
Godly mission. Stay firm in your dedication to yajna, to
God, to nature and to society.

In this world of Savita’s creation, with the
strength and vigour of prana and apana, and with the
power and prowess of the bold and the brave I do
homage to the man of learning and dedication and accept
yajna as a mission so that I may catch the wicked and
the evil by the neck and eliminate them head and foot
from life and society. You are young and fast, speed
itself. Drive away hate and fear from us. Eliminate
poverty, adversity and failure. May all the people
cooperate and join in the yajna in the search for the
light of truth and universal Dharma, for exploration of
the sky and space and for enrichment of the earth and
the environment. This is the assembly of the wise and
the learned people. May all the people join these men
of knowledge and be enlightened. O woman, you are
strong and bold. You too join in this venture.
