CHAPTER-V 109

Mitrasya ma caksuseksadhvam agnayah
sagarah sagara stha sagarena namna
raudrenanikena pata ma’ gnayah piprta ma’
gnayo gopayata ma namo vo’stu ma ma himsista.

Men of knowledge, worthy of praise,
broadminded as the sky, voracious as fire for knowledge
and passionate for work, look at me favourably with
the eye of friends. Remain broad-minded and liberal.
Liberal and gracious as you are, protect me with the
fiery passion for knowledge and power in growth and
development. May the men of the fire of yajna and
science fill and full me with plenty and let me grow in
safety and peace. Salutations to you! Pray hurt me not,
destroy me not.

35. (Agni Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)

तनूकवद्भ्यो द्वेषोभ्योऽन्य्कृतेभ्यऽउरु यन्तासि वरूंथश्डंस्वाहां
जुषाणोऽअप्तुरार्ज्यस्य वेतु स्वाहां ॥३५॥

Jyotirasi visvarupam visvesam devanam samit.
Tvam soma taniukrdbhyo dvesobhyo’ nyakrte-
bhya’uru yantasi varutham svaha jusano’
apturdjyasya vetu svaha.

Agni, you are the light of universal knowledge, a
flame of fire for the scholars of the world to light up and
reveal the form and structure of the world. Soma you are
the vast power of order and control over the envious, the
self-expansive servers of the flesh, the negative and
uncreative people. May the lover of tecknowledge, fast
and anxious, choose to dedicate himself to the great and
valuable secrets and powers of agni, and know and
confirm the divine voice of the Veda.
