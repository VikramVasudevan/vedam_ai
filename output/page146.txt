CHAPTER-V 113

Vishnu, man of courage and knowledge wide
expansive as the wind, equip yourself with the knowledge
of science and technology and expand our comfort and
happiness. Man sipping holy water just as fire consumes
ghee and electricity in the sky consumes water in the
clouds, drink deep at the fount of knowledge. Help the
master of yajna to overcome the hurdles and swim across
the seas with the chant of the Veda.

Agni/Master of knowledge, I won’t go to the
fools. I would go to the others, to the wise, yes, to the
wise only. You are higher than the highest (in
knowledge), and closer than the closest (in love). I
would be with you, know you, attain to you.

Lord/Master of herbs, brilliant and generous, we
love you and adore you for the sake of gifts of knowledge
and life’s inspiration. May all the devas, noble ones,
love you and adore you for the same gifts of knowledge
and blessings for the sake of Vishnu, lord of yajna.

Life-giving herbs, power of the lord, save this
man, save this yajna, hurt not, kill not.
