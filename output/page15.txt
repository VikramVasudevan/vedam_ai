APPRECIATION

Ihave gone through some chapters of the English translation
of Yajurveda by Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma. As he has stated at the
very beginning of the Introduction, this translation of Yajurveda
is meant for an average English-knowing reader who is keen to
know: What is Veda? What is it about? Is it old or new? To achieve
this object, he has followed the Arsh method of interpretation.
Accordingly, for example, he has mostly followed the
etymological method of literal translation. But whenever he finds
that the literal is not helpful in achieving his intended objective,
he adds the implied explanation so that the essence of the Vedic
hymn is quite clear. For example, his translation of, 'Yathemam
Vacham Kalyanimavadani janebhyah' is rendered as follows-'Just
as I speak (reveal) this auspicious holy Word of the Veda for all
people (without discrimination of high or low), so should you
too communicate it to all people of the world, whosoever,
whatsoever, where so ever they be’. That is the technique of Swami
Dayananda also.

I regard Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma as one in the commendable
line of Pundit Damodar Satavalekara who studied Sanskrit at a
mature age and did unique work in that language. Dr. Sharma has
also mastered the Sanskrit language after his retirement and done
full justice to the translation of the Veda. He richly deserves our
gratefulness, our expression of gratification and our appreciation
for succeeding in his sacred mission of presenting an
understandable, logical and above all sensible English translation
of Vedas which hitherto was unavailable. Thus a long felt need
has been fulfilled. I am sure Dr Sharma's method of translation
will not only be widely approved but will also be followed by
others while translating the Vedas in other languages.
