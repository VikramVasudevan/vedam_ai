CHAPTER-VI 117

The houses of the government we would wish to
visit are those which are bright with the light of Lord
Vishnu’s glory of human art and awareness so that we
exclaim spontaneously: “Ah! here is the place where
the highest offices in Vishnu’s dispensation are wholly
and exclusively held by learned and meritorious people”.
I know your Brahma system of education and research,
your Kshatra system of defence, justice and peace, your
economic system of production and distribution.
Strengthen and extend education and enlightenment,
consolidate and advance governance and administration,
improve and promote health and age, strengthen and
expand the welfare of the people.

Watch the divine acts of Vishnu, omnipresent lord
of the universe, acts of creation, sustenance and
annihilation of the world, wherein are manifested the
inviolable laws of His dominion operative in nature.
Therein I see the sacred rules of conduct and
administration of my dominion too and I bind myself
irrevocably as a friend of the lord of universal power
and as an instrument of His will. Watch, meditate, learn
and bind yourselves too to the rules of this dominion
and His.
