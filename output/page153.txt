120 YAJURVEDA

In this yajna of the creation of the refulgent and
generous Lord Savita, with the arms of Ashvinis (powers
and virtues of the sun and moon), and with the generous
hands of Pusha (the fertility and sustenance of the earth’s
gravitation and stability), I accept you, favoured as you
are as a child by Agni, lord of light and heat, and Soma,
lord of life and peace. I enjoin you to the discipline of
brahmacharya with waters and herbs to enjoy and
consecrate you, loved as you are by Agni and Soma.
May your mother agree, your father approve, your
brother support and your friends of the group cooperate.

10. (Apah Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

अपां terenat देवी: स्वंदन्तु tard चित्सर्देवहवि: 1a

You are a protector of the waters (through yajna).
May all the living beings taste and enjoy the sweet and
celestial waters and other things of their own like the
blessed gifts from yajna. May you, with all your body
and will, and by my blessings (1.e., the teacher’s
blessings) help and cooperate with those who are
dedicated to yajna. May your very breath rise with the
wind carrying the fragrance. Be a master of yajna.
