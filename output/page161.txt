22. (Varuna Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

मापो मौर्षधीर्हिश्सीर्धाम्नों धाम्नो wsieadt वरुण नो मुञ्च।
यदाहुरघ्न्याऽइति वरुणेति vraag dat वरुण नो मुञ्च।
सुमित्रिया नऽआपऽऒओर्षधय: सन्तु दुर्मित्रियास्तस्मै सन्तु
योऽऽस्मान् द्वेष्टि यं चं aa द्विष्म: ॥२२॥

Mapo mausadhirhimsirdhamno dhamno
rajamstato varuna no munca. Yadahuraghnya iti
varuneti Sapamahe tato varuna no munca.
Sumitriya na’apa’osadhayah santu durmitriya-
stasmai santu yo’sman dvesti yam ca vayam
dvismah.

Head of the republic, pollute not the waters,
destroy not herbs and trees: From this, from any other
place, leave us not out, except no one from this. Let
things like water and refreshment be available anywhere,
everywhere.

Lord of justice, water, herbs and trees, cows are
sacred, they are not to be destroyed: This you vouchsafe,
we too take the oath. Back not out. We too will not
back out. Under your governance, may waters and herbs
be like friends to us. And they would be unfriendly to
those elements which injure us and our sanctity, and to
those ailments which we oppose, they would be enemies.

23. (Ap-yajna Surya Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)

gtastdtarsstrat हविष्माँ २॥ऽआर्विवासति।
हविष्मान्देवोऽर्ध्वरो हविष्मा २॥ऽअस्तु Wa: ॥२३॥
