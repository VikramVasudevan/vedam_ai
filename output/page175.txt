142 YAJURVEDA

Raya vayam sasavamso madema havyena deva
yavasena gavah. Tam dhenum mitravaruna
yuvam no visvaha dhattamanapasphurantim-esa
te yonirrtayubhyam tva.

Noble men of discriminative knowledge and
wisdom, let us rejoice on wealth fit to be offered to the
gods for food, rejoice just as cows enjoy the green grass.

Teachers and students of yoga, friends like pranic
energies, both of you attain and preserve for us the voice
of divine knowledge, Veda, versatile and eternal giver
of universal knowledge, revealed in the state of
Samadhi.

Yajamana, this knowledge is your element, your
very home of existence. We do homage to you alongwith
the seekers of divine law through yoga.

11. (Ashvinav Devate, Medhatithi Rshi)

या at कशा मर्धुमत्यश्विंना सूनूर्तावती 1 dat aw
मिंमिक्षतम्। scrmidisatasat त्वैष ते arated

त्वा ॥११॥

Ya vam kasa madhumatyasvina sunrtavati. Taya
yajnam mimiksatam. Upayamagrhito’
syasvibhyam tvaisa te yonirmadhvibhyam tva.

Teacher and seeker of yoga, bright as Ashwins
(sun and moon), advance your yajna of yoga in the light
of the divine voice of the Veda, so sweet, so true, so
inspiring.

Seeker of yoga, sanctified in the discipline of
yama and niyama (social and personal ethics of purity),
this yoga is your element, your very home of existence.
