powerful as Indra and Agni (power and fire), come and,
with words of enlightenment, create for us the wanted
joy and prosperity. With your knowledge and mind, and
our suggestions and request, guard this land and protect
the prosperity of the people.

People of the land/Ruler and the Councillors,
accepted and positioned you are in the laws and
constitution of the state. You (the people) are dedicated
to Indra and Agni (the ruler and the council), and
accepted in law. You, the ruler and the councillors, are
dedicated to Indra and Agni, Lord of Power and
knowledge, and Lord of the people and the land. This
constitution and this land is your mainstay, the meaning
and justification of your being and position.
