Marutvan’ indra vrsabho ranaya piba soma-
manusvadham maddya. Asifcasva jathare
madhva’ urmim tvam raja’ si pratipatsutanam.
Upayamagrhito’ sindraya tva marutvata’ esa te

Indra, head of the council/commander of the
army, leader of the people/army, first and best among
all, you are a man of honour and power. For joy and for
the battles, drink soma according to your taste and
capacity with every meal. Stimulate your appetite with
draughts of the best and the choicest sweets of juices.
You are intelligent and brilliant for every occasion of
importance.

Accepted and consecrated you are in the laws of
the land and rules of the council/army. We honour and
celebrate you in the service of the lord of the land and
head of the people. You are dedicated and committed to
the honour of the land and the welfare of the people for
the development of airy weapons and missiles (marut-
weapons). This commitment, this dedication, now is
your haven, the very meaning and purpose of your
existence.
