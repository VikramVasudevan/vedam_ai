166 YAJURVEDA

May this warrior, agni, clear the path for us. May
this warrior, breaking through the enemy lines in front,
advance on and on. May this one, fighting in the thick
of battle, win the battles one after another. And may
this one win the victory over the enemies and rejoice.
(May one look after the wounded and treat them with
medicine.)

45. (Prajapati Devata, Angirasa Rshi)
रूपेणं at रूपमभ्यार्गो dat al विश्वर्वेदा faving |
mae पथा Ud चन्द्र्दक्षिणा fa wa: पश्य व्युन्तरिक्षं
यर्तस्व सदस्यै: ॥४५॥

Rupena vo rupamabhyagam tutho vo visvaveda
vibhajatu. Rtasya patha preta candradaksina vi
svah pasya vyantariksam yatasva sadasyaih.

With a descerning eye, I see the various grades
of ability among you. The one who knows you all and
knows the world may form you into different classes
and councils for appropriate jobs. The highest in
intelligence may touch the skies — realise the divine
presence and the eternal values of life and action. Ruler
of the people, with the members of the council, by the
path of truth, act and move on. Men of golden
generosity, go ahead on the path of Dharma with charity.
(The ruler should constitute three councils: The Council
of Education, Vidyarya Sabha, The Council of
Governance, Rajarya Sabha, and the Council of Dharma,
Dharmarya Sabha, to assist and advise him in the
governance and administration of the country.)

46. (Vidvans Devata, Angirasa Rshi)
