CHAPTER-VII 169

48. (Atma Devata, Angirasa Rshi)

कोंऽदात्कस्मांऽअदात्कामोंऽदात्कामांयादात् |
carat दाता कार्म: प्रतिग्रहीता कामैतत्तें secu

Ko’datkasma’adatkamo ’datkamayadat. Kamo
data kamah pratigrahita kamaitatte.
Who gives? For whom ....? Desire gives. Gives

for desire. Desire is the giver. Desire is the receiver. It
is all desire. Love for you! For fulfilment.

Who gives the fruit of karma? To whom does the
giver give the fruit of karma? Ishwara, Divine love and
desire, gives the fruit of karma. He gives the fruit of
karma to the jiva, the soul, who desires and acts the
karma. Ishwara is the object of love and desire for the
yogis. He is the giver. The jiva desires and acts out of
desire. He is the receiver of the fruit. It is all desire.
This is for you — the knowledge. It is for you to know.
(You cannot live without desire, and you cannot survive
only with desire. Integrate desire (kama) with Dharma
and Artha, and you’ll have both life and freedom
(moksha).
