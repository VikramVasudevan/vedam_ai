( xxiv )

Sanskrit with a missionary motive, the translation of Sanskrit
Scriptures into English was but the next and ‘logical’ step
with that same missionary motive of conversion, one to extol,
the other to denigrate:

One example, of extolment, is the following translation of
the Bible, ‘The Gospel according to John’:

Yohana-likhitah Susamvadah;
Ishvarasya vakyam Yishor mahatvam avatara katha ca.

Jesus here is presented as an Avatara, someone a very God
for the traditional Hindu, although the Gospel does not mention
the incarnation at all. (The translation of The Bible in Sanskrit by
J.Wenger is available on the internet.)

The other example, of denigration, is given here below from
W.D. Whitney’s translation of the Atharvaveda (7, 107, 1) edited
and revised by K.L. Joshi, published by Parimal Publications,
Delhi, 2004:

Namaskrtya dyavaprthivibhyamantariksaya mrtyave.
Meksamyurdhvastisthan ma ma hinsishuritsvarah.

“Having paid homage to heaven and earth, to the
atmosphere, to Death, I will urinate standing erect; let not the
Lords (Ishvara) harm me.”

I give below an English rendering of the same mantra
translated by Pundit Satavalekara in Hindi:

“Having done homage to heaven and earth and to the middle
regions and Death (Yama), I stand high and watch (the world of
life). Let not my masters hurt me.”

An English rendering of the same mantra translated by
Pundit Jai Dev Sharma in Hindi is the following:

“Having done homage to heaven and earth (i.e. father and
mother) and to the immanent God and Yama (all Dissolver),
standing high and alert, I move forward in life. These masters of
mine, pray, may not hurt me.”
