CHAPTER-VIII 177

You are the redeemer from the sin committed by
the generous superman; you are the saviour from the
sin committed by the ordinary person; you are the
redeemer from the sins committed by the forefathers; you
are the redeemer from the sin committed by one’s own
self; you are the redeemer from the sins begotten of sin.
Whatever the sin I have committed in a state of
knowledge, or I have committed in a state of ignorance
(or I might commit in future), you are the saviour from
all that.

14. (Grihapatis Devata, Bharadwaja Rshi)
सं ada पर्यसा सं तनूभिरर्गन्महि ater सश्शिवेर्न।
त्वष्टां सुदत्रो fadend warsdare cat यद्वित्लिष्टम्॥१४॥

Sam varcasa payasa sam tanubhiraganmahi
manasa sam sivena. Tvasta sudatro vidadhatu
rayo’ numarstu tanvo yadvilistam.

Twashta, refiner of manners, behaviour, method,
and culture and generous giver of health, wealth and
knowledge, let us go forward with a noble mind, able
body, plenty of food and drink and the vigour and lustre
of life. Give us all-round wealth of life, and whatever is
wanting in us in health of body and mind, be gracious
to make up and complete.

15. (Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)
सर्मिन्द्र णो मर्नसा नेषि गोभि: सश्सूरिर्भिर्मघवन्त्स्स्वस्त्या।
सं ब्रर्मणा dad यदस्ति सं देवार्नाश्रंसुमतौ यज्ञिर्यानाडं
स्वाहां ॥१५॥
Samindra no manasa nesi gobhih sam
suribhirmaghavant sam svastya. Sam brahmana

devakrtam yadasti sam devanam sumatau
yajniyanam svaha.
