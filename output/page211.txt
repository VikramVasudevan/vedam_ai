178 YAJURVEDA

Indra, Lord of power and honour, Maghavan,
Lord of wealth and knowledge, take us forward in a
healthy state of mind and sense at peace, comfortably,
with men of wisdom and brilliant intelligence, with the
vaidic voice of universal knowledge, and with our cows,
into the way of whatever is nobly done in the vaidic
tradition of universal values, and whatever is good
according to the noble genius of the superior people of
yajnic dedication and culture.

16. (Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)
सं aden पर्यसा सं तनूभिरर्गन्महि मर्नसा सश्शिवेर्न।
त्वष्टां सुदत्रो विर्दंधातु Warsqares at यद्दिर्लिष्टम्॥१६॥

Sam varcasa payasa sam tanubhiraganmahi
manasa sam sivena. Tvasta sudatro vidadhatu
rayo’ numarstu tanvo yadvilistam.

Follow as we do the noble genius of superior
people among us, bless us Twashta, remover of the veils
of ignorance and giver of knowledge. By the bright day
and in the night, with the help and guidance of healthy
and intelligent scholars and sages, and with the gift ofa
noble mind and concentration, bless us with the wealth
of life, knowledge, wisdom, health and culture, and
cleanse us of all the negativities and impurities of body
and mind.

17. (Vishvedeva Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)
erat Ufa: dade र्जुषन्तां प्रजार्पतिर्निधिपा देवोऽअग्नि:।
त्वष्टा विष्णुं: प्रजयां सश्रराणा यर्जमानाय द्रविंणं aera
स्वाहा ॥१७॥
