23. (Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)

werdaarss | अपदे पादा प्रतिंधातवेऽकरुतार्पवक्ता
हृदयाविर्धश्चित् ॥ नमो चरुंणायाभिष्ठितो वरुंणस्य
urst: ॥२३॥

Mahirbhurma prdakuh. Uruin hi raja varuna-
Scakara suryaya panthamanve-tava’u. Apade
pada pratidhatave’karutapavakta hrdaya-
vidhascit. Namo varunayabhisthito varunasya
pasah.

Ruler and President of the Council, be not angry
and poisonous as a snake, nor ferocious as a serpent.
Be not false, hurtful and heart-breaking in speech. Be a
ruler shining brilliant, supreme in virtue. Do excellently
as behoves your chosen status. Make the highways of
justice broad in honour and worship to the sun, the
supreme light of the world, for all to see and follow the
light so that none may stray into the paths of evil. Let
the rule of law and the penal code be as firm and
inviolable as the chains of Varuna and the thunderbolt
of Indra.

24. (Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)

अग्नेरनीकमपऽआर्विवेशापान्नर्पात् प्रतिरर्क्षन्नसुर्यम् ।दर्मेदमे
समिर्धे यक्ष्यग्ने प्रति ते जिह्वा घृतमुर्च्चरण्यत् स्वाहां ॥॥२४॥
