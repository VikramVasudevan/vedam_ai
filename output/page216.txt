CHAPTER-VIII 183

Agneranitkamapa’ त vivesapam-nap@t prati-
raksannasuryam. Damedame samidham
yaksyagne prati te jihva ghrtamuccaranyat
svaha.

Agni, brilliant and generous house-holder, enter
the flames of fire and the depth of waters and know
their secrets of power. Protector of the waters, digging
into and protecting the material wealth of the earth and
ocean, go from house to house, and light the fire of
material knowledge of energy and its applications. Let
the tongue of the truthful man taste the sweets of life
and proclaim.

25. (Grihapati Devata, Atri Rshi)

समुद्रे ते हृदयमप्स्वुन्त: सं wal विशान्त्वोर्षधीरुतार्प:। aaet
त्वा यज्ञपते Gertie नमोवाके faery यत् Carat neg ul

Samudre te hrdayamapsvantah sam tva
visantvosadhirutapah. Yajnasya tva yajnapate
suktoktau’ namovake vidhema yat svaha.
Yajnapati, pursuant of yajna, we put your heart
and mind in touch with vital energies and dynamic
modes of social conduct and behaviour revealed in the
hymns of the Vedas dealing with foods, source
materials, and yajnic cooperation of the community. Let
your searching mind go deep down into the ocean and
rise up into the waters of space. And then celestial waters
and rejuvenating herbs would emerge into your mind’s
eye of discovery (for common good).
