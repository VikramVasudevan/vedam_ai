Initiated and consecrated couple in grihastha,
gentle, noble and lovable virtuous producers of wealth,
you are one of the bright, meritorious and generous
community. You are an instrument of the devas.

Deva, lord of the bright and the generous, living
with the noble ones and the ordinary people, I pray,
that I keep away from any sin or misconduct or
misbehaviour committed with the mind and senses, or
with the body, or by the ordinary people or even by the
superior ones. Save me from violence to Dharma —
such violence is the root of all sin and crime.
