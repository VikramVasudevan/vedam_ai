186 YAJURVEDA

The man of mighty deeds, who eliminates
suffering and creates joy, of versatile attainments, bright
and honourable, constant and resolute, should wait for
the great new arrival.

Men of the household, cultivate the vaidic culture
of one, two, three, four and eight steps of attainment:
one: Aum; two: worldly fulfilment and the freedom of
moksha; three: the joy of the truth of word and the health
of body and mind; four: the attainment of Dharma,
wealth, fulfilment of desire, and moksha; eight: the joy
of all the four classes and all the four stages of life
(Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra,
Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa).
Build homes for the people and advance in life.

31. (Dampati Devate, Gotama Rshi)
asa यस्य fe era पाथा fear विंमहस: |
स सुंगोपार्तमो set: ॥३१॥

Maruto yasya hi ksaye patha divo vimahasah.
Sa sugopatamo janah.

Married couples, brilliant and great in many ways,
blest with beauty, wealth, yajna and knowledge,
wherever in a home you find superior people of noble
nature, character and action, that family is most
dedicated to mother earth and the Veda.

32. (Dampati Devate, Medhatithi Rshi)

मही et: diet च नऽइमं ag मिंमिक्षताम् ।
पिपृतां नो भरीमभि: ॥३२॥

Mahi dyauh prthivi ca na’ imam yajnam
mimiksatam. Piprtam no bharimabhih.
