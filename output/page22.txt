( xxv )

I would like to quote my own translation of the mantra now
under print:

“Having done homage to heaven and earth, and to the middle
regions, and having acknowledged the fact of death as inevitable
counterpart of life under God’s dispensation, now standing high,
I watch the world and go forward with showers of the cloud. Let
no powers of earthly nature hurt and violate me.”

‘Showers of the cloud’ is a metaphor, as in Shelley’s poem
‘the Cloud’: “I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers”,
which suggests a lovely rendering.

The problem here arises from the verb ‘mekshami’ from
the root ‘mih’ which means ‘to shower’ (sechane). It depends on
the translator’s sense and attitude to sacred writing how the
message is received and communicated in an interfaith context
with no strings attached (or unattached).

This extolment and denigration was happening around the
time when the English language, English education and missionary
work had been introduced into India and was raging on top. Swami
Dayananda faced this challenge with boldness and caution, still
with an open mind, all prepared even for correction. He based his
interpretation of the Vedas on Nirukta and the etymological
principles of word interpretation, and interpretation of the word
in the context, both local and total, because the local is an integral
part of the total whole.

We are living in an age of science and reason, democracy
and freedom, globalism and global communication, and we feel
the need for a free and frank interfaith dialogue. In such an age,
ritualism and mythology is not enough. If we want to understand
and present Veda as a body of universal knowledge and
articulation of divine awareness of existence, there is no escape
from Yaska, Panini, Patanjali, Dayananda and Aurobindo, because
they provide the key principles and practice of scientific
interpretation of an ancient scientific language such as Vedic
Sanskrit which has no historical parallel for comparison. The
