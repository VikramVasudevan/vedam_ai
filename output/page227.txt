194 YAJURVEDA

the divine worthy of praise, love abiding in the heart,
libation for the gods and fragrance of yajna, love and
desire incarnate, beauty of the moon, brilliance of virtue,
unbreakable and boundless, inexhaustible stream of
knowledge and generosity, forbearance of mother earth,
celebrity of the world: these are your names, dear wife,
inviolable, which describe woman’s nature and
character. Speak to me of the good things I ought to do.

Indra, commander of the army, destroy our
enemies, keep the enemy hoards down. Him who wants
to beat us into slavery, throw down into the dark.

Accepted you are by the people and consecrated
in the rules and tactics of the army for the defence of
the land and destruction of the enemy. This is now your
haven and home, the sole purpose of your office. We
dedicate you to the defence and security of the land and
to the honour of the nation.
