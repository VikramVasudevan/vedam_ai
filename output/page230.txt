Dear husband, if amongst the pure and spotless
people, you ever happen to waver, I shake you out of
that fickleness.

If amongst the gentle folk in speech and language,
love and manners, you happen to falter, I shake you out
of that embarrassment.

If amongst the graceful and the beatifying, you
happen to err toward roughness, I shake you out back
into self-awareness.

If in the company of the rejoicing folks in
festivity, you waver from self-control, I shake you out
back to temperance.

If amongst the sweetest and the most lovable folks
you waver from decency, I shake you back to civility.

You are pure and immaculate. I would always
warn you against going astray and urge upon you to
stay untainted in character as the day in the rays of the
sun.
