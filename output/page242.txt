For the sake of Indra, lord of glory, and for you,
I take the life-giving essence of the waters (juices)
collected and ripened in the sun. And I take the finest
essence of the essences of waters and hold the
quintessence of vitality for the glow of health and life.

By virtue of your discipline and values and the
means at your command, you are accepted and
consecrated for the sake of honour and prosperity of
the nation. Loved and respected as you are, I accept
and elect you. This choice and consecration is now your
haven and home. Most loved and respected, you are
now committed and dedicated to the glory of Indra and
his people.
