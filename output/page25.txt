destroy. Moreover let them have no side effects because side
effects too aggravate the negativities and injure us.” This is the
reasonable prayer and health programme of an advanced society.
And then, logically in the next mantra, follows the prayer for a
full hundred years and more of life and healthy living (Yajurveda,
36, 24). Veda thus is food for thought.

In human terms: If a legendary celebrity can admire another
human figure as “inscrutable, apocalyptic, a mysterious poem
written in flesh and blood”, how much more — infinitely more—
mysterious, inscrutable, apocalyptic would be the Cosmic Poem
(Devasya Kavyah) created in the language of the Ultimate Vision?

Veda is a Cosmic Poem: the more we know, the more we
know the Veda, and the more we know the Veda, the more we
know.

Indeed, every reader should stand before the Veda, every
verse of It in fact, as Arjuna stood before the Cosmic Krishna,
waiting and watching intently, for the burst of a thousand suns,
for the Dawn on top of the Earth, for the Revelation.

May the light burst forth, I pray.

—Tulsi Ram
