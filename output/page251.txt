218 YAJURVEDA

Passionate but controlled, brilliant, esteemed and
well-maintained warriors with their horses, swift in
action, seizing by the neck the serpents, wolves and
demons of the society, be good and auspicious to us,
saving us from social pollution and giving us lasting
peace and security in the noble men’s yajnas and battles
of life for development and progress.

and self-disciplined, expert men of a thousand themes
and subjects, who have heard and meditated on the
shastras, who deserve,desire, offer and receive their

suggestions and prayers in national projects and may
promote and maintain our great wealth and honour.
