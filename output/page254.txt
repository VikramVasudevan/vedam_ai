CHAPTER-IX 221

hearing by yajna, hearing the sacred voice; may your
faculty of enquiry grow efficient by yajna, mutual
dialogue; may your yajna — reverence, society and
charity — grow by yajna, performance in action.

May we continue to be the children of Prajapati,
father of humanity (and of the ruler of the nation). May
we become noble and virtuous and attain eternal
freedom, happiness and immortality.

May our mind and perception, power and force,
be for you and yours for us; all our wealth, thought and
action, brilliance and achievement be yours, and yours
for us. Reverence to the mother earth. The wealth and
glory of the earth is yours for the mother. You are for
the mother, for farming, for protection and growth, for
production of wealth, for health and nourishment. You
are the leader, disciplined controller, firm and constant,
support of all, for the mother.
