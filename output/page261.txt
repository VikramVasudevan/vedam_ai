228 YAJURVEDA

Mitra, universal friend of all, with nine-syllable
yajushi brihati verse, won the three dimensional yajna
of knowledge, action and worship. I too should
accomplish the same. (The ruler should live an
enlightened life of action and piety, and every citizen
should follow the ruler and support him.)

Varuna, the Supreme, worthy of choice, with the
ten-syllable yajushi pankti verse, conquered the spirit
and content of Virat, policy of sovereignty. I too should
realize the same.

(The ruler should honour the sovereignty of his
office, commit himself to policies of eternal values and
be the guardian of his people. The people should honour
and follow him in his foot-steps.)

Indra, Lord of glory, with eleven-syllable asurya
pankti verse, won the spirit and content of trishtup, and
I should realize the same.

(The ruler should pursue the values and policies
of magnanimity and excellence, and the people should
emulate and support him.)

Vishve-devas, noble spirits of the world, with
twelve-syllable gayatri verse, realized the spirit and
content of jagati, and I should realize the same.

(The ruler should commit himself to the highest
policies of social life and universal good, and the people
should follow and support him.)

34. (Vasus and Others Devatas, Tapasa Rshi)
