CHAPTER-X 253

Ruler of the land, you are like the thunderbolt of
Indra (lightning) in power, inviolable, clean and
spotless. I appoint you by the advice of the Governor of
the council and the commander of the army for the
exercise of your official powers freely and
constructively without pain or fear or tyranny. Act with
the inspiration, advice and support of the positive yajnic
people of dynamic spirit and win your victories/goals.
We are with you with all our will and power.

22. (Indra Devata, Devavata Rshi)

मा dss a aad र्तुराषाडर्युक्तासोऽअब्रह्मता facar |
`तिष्ठा tants a चंज्रहस्ता रश्मीन्देव ana ea
ऽर्वान् ॥२२॥

Ma ta’ indra te vayam turadsadayuktdaso
abrahmata vidasama. Tistha rathamadhi yam
vajrahasta rasmin deva yamase svasvan.

Indra, Ruler of the land, hero of the thunderbolt in
hand, swift as you are in action and victory over the
enemy, may we, your officers and people, never,
disaffected, fall off from you. May you too never suffer
disaffection from Ishwara and never fall off from your
faith.

Hero of the people, thunderbolt in hand, ascend
and ride the chariot, take the reins in hand by which
you drive the steeds and, swift in action, achieve your
goals.

23. (Agni & Others Devatas, Devavata Rshi)
अग्नये गुहर्पतये स्वाहा सोर्माय वनस्पर्तये स्वार्हा मरुतामोर्जसे
स्वाहेन्द्रस्येन्द्रियाय स्वार्हा । पृर्थिवि मातर्मा at हिश्सीर्मोऽअहं
त्वाम् ॥२३॥
