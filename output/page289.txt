28. (Yajamana Devata, Shunahshepa Rshi)

सवितासिं wetaar वरुंणोऽसि सत्यौजाऽइन्द्रोऽसि विशौजा

Subduer of the evil and the wicked, you are the
dominant ruler. May all the five directions be favourable
to you. Man of spiritual vision and knowledge, you are
a scholar of the Vedas and creator of all comfort and
joy, light and honour with noble actions of truth. Man
of first and best choice, possessed of excellence, truth
is your real power and lustre. Man of dignity and
majesty, your greatness lies in the strength and support
of the people. Man of justice, destroyer of sin and crime,
harbinger of various kinds of happiness, doer of good
over and over again, you are the thunderbolt of lightning
action. With that instant power, protect me, save me,
perfect me.
