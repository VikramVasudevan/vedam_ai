CHAPTER-X 259

prepare for the honour and defence of the nation.
Seasoned and sanctified as the pure wind through noble
conduct and performance, be worthy of respect and
admiration. Rise in knowledge, dignity and grace, be
lovable as soma and the moon, and you would be a
chosen companion of Indra, the ruler, and the Supreme
Lord of life.

Senior men of knowledge sitting around the fire
on seats of grass chant words of homage in praise of
the divine. Treat them to food and liberal hospitality
with reverence.

The farmers harvest barley in a certain order, sift
the grain from the chaff and keep it safe. Protect the
farmers, and, like them, sift the grain of truth from the
chaff of untruth and protect the truth.
