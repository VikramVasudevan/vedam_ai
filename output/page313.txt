Learned teacher, man of knowledge, just as the
morning sun, rising between the heaven and earth,
beautiful, of various wonders, as its warmth is absorbed
in the herbs, dispels the shades of darkness from the
heaven and earth and moves on rising in its glory, so
should the child grow up gaining the light of knowledge
to shine in the life of its parents in the home.
