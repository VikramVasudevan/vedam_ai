simple, straight, constant and eternal. We observe it in
life and conduct. We know the truth of existence, real
and dynamic. We follow it in thought, word and deed.
We bear and use ‘agni’, the energy of nature, life’s mode
of preservation and promotion, and scientific means of
protection and prosperity. It blesses herbs, trees and
other vegetation, and these give us health and energy.

Listen you all, this agni is come, so good and
blissful. Welcome it in response and rejoice.

Be seated, man of science and medicine. Drive
off all that is enervating and infectious. Throw off all
that is stupid and ill-disposed.
