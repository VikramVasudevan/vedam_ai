Dear husband, blest with various strength and
power, bright and pure as agni (light), great, prosperous
and generous, dedicated to yajna and social life, stop
and remove the jealous, hostile and wicked enemies of
our married life, and I would live happy in your beautiful
home of love and peace, observing your noble values
of life.
