52, 1 and 1, 36, 1 for the science of missile defence and space-
craft, to 6, 46, 11 for missiles and war heads, and so on. Position
of the solar system with planets and satellites, earth’s and sun’s
gravitation, solar healing, parliamentary democracy,
organisational structure of the nation and the international world,
water and electric energy, and so many other subjects are hinted
at in Vedic verses. We need serious research to work out the
details. Had even Einstein read the Purusha Sukta of the Vedas
and Brahma Sutras and Sankhya Vaisheshika philosophy,
probably he would have found clues to his Unified Field theory
of the universe.

Beyond faith and intelligential solemnity we need vision,
potential Darshan of the Vedic Rshis. Once you have had the
vision of truth, doubts disappear and questions recede into silence
because then, nothing shines but the Truth, and Divinity Itself
reveals It’s Reality with showers of Grace. In this mood and in
this spirit, I suggest, you start your search for Vedic Truth and
the Mystery of Existence.

Lastly, if the Vedic lore is as old as humanity itself, what
is its relevance today in the modern world? Ask yourself other
questions: What is the relevance of Galileo or Newton or the
Theory of Relativity, two plus two makes four, Swaraj, the Vedic
word for freedom and self-discipline? Truth is truth, when the
statement was made is irrelevant. Vedic truth, if you find it
convincing and acceptable, is relevant not only for today but also
for all time, to every person, everywhere.

Yajurveda itself says (26, 2):
‘“Yathemam vacham kalyanim avadani janebhyah”:

Just as I speak (reveal) this auspicious holy Word of the
Veda for all people (without any discrimination of high or low),
so should you too communicate it to all people of the world
whoever, whatever, wherever they be.

—Tulsi Ram
