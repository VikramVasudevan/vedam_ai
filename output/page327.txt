66. (Agni & others Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

प्रयुजश्डस्वाहां प्रजार्पतये मर्नवे स्वाहाग्नरये वैश्वानराय
स्वाहां ॥६६॥

Akitimagnim prayujain svaha mano medham-
agnim prayujam svaha cittam vijnadtamagnim
prayujam svaha vaco vidhrtimagnim prayujam
svaha prajapataye manave svaha’ gnaye
vaisvanaraya svaha.
With truth of word and action, light the fire which
inspires to courageous thinking and collective decision.

With truth and honesty of social behaviour, light
up the inner vitality which inspires the mind to will and
the intellect to analyse and understand the problems of
life.

With honest social action, promote the agni,
social will, which inspires chitta, instrument of
knowledge, to think and preserve the knowledge already
gained.
