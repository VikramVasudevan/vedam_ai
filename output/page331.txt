298 YAJURVEDA

Young man/woman, brilliant like fire, whatever
things are for you, all those we place on the shelf. Accept
and take all that as fire accepts the oblations of ghee.
All that is ours is yours. All that is yours is ours too.

74. (Agni Devata, Jamadagni Rshi)

aenufater aq amssifradte ।
सर्वं तदंस्तु ते gd asaeca यविष्ठ्य ॥७४॥

Yadattyupajihvika yad vamro atisarpati. Sarvam
tadastu te ghrtam tajjusasva yavisthya.

Young man/woman of excellence, brilliant as fire,
whatever the woman/man of controlled taste and tongue
eats, and howsoever her/his breath flows in and out, all
that is yours, for you. That is for your love and joy.
Take all that as fire consumes the oblations.

75. (Agni Devata, Nabhanedishtha Rshi)

अर्हरहररप्रयावं भरन्तोऽश्वायेव fase घासर्मस्मै ।
रायस्पोर्षेण समिषा मदन्तोऽग्ने मा a प्रतिवेशा रिषाम॥७५॥

Aharaharaprayavam bharanto’ svayeva tisthate
ghasamasmai. Rayasposena samisa madanto’ -
gene ma te prativesa risama.

Agni, learned man of justice and brilliance, just
as we bear lovely green grass for a horse in the stables
every day, so we bear good and wholesome food and
other things to this fair and just house-holder as his
partners in good deeds of Dharma. May we, enjoying
ourselves with plenty of food and energy, health and
wealth with him, never injure the honour and reputation
of this noble man out of jealousy.
