सासहिम् ॥७६॥

Nabha prthivyah samidhane’agnau radyasposaya
brhate havamahe. Irammadam brhaduktham
yajatram jetaramagnim prtanasu sasahim.

When the fire is lit in the vedi in the heart of the
land and the battle is raging for abundance and
prosperity and for high national honour, we call upon
agni, a fiery leader with electric action, victorious in
battle and of tremendous endurance, himself a man of
plenty and prosperity, admirable of character and
adorable in performance. (We call upon such a man to
lead the nation.)

Yah sena’ abhitvaritravyadhinirugana `प्रांत. Ye

stena ye ca taskarastanste’agne’pidadhamyasye.

There are the forces up against in arms, large,

swift and ready to strike. There are the thieves and the

smugglers. All these that are there, I throw into the

flames of fire. President of the Council, commander of
the army, you do the same.
