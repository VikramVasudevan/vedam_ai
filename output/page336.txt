is who creates the man of knowledge and vision (to
show the divine path of life to others).

द्रविणोदा: ॥२॥

Natkosadsa samanasa virupe dhapayete
Sisumekam samict. Dyavaksama rukmo’
antarvibhati deva ’agnitn dharayan dravinodah.

The night and the dawn, one dark, the other

together nurse one child, the sun, like two mothers. The
self-luminous agni, light and life of the universe — of
which the sun is a child — pervades both the earth and
