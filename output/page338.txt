brain by which you ward off the miseries of others. The
knowledge of gayatri verses is your eye and vision.
Brihad-rathantara sama verses are like your wings,
something like a chariot by which you can cross the
rivers of misery. Rigveda is your soul. The chhanda
verses of the Veda are like the limbs of your body. The
verses of Yajurveda are like your name and identity.
Samaveda is like your body. The do’s and dont’s of the

sun, master of grandeur. Rise to the heavens. Find the
bliss of heaven.
