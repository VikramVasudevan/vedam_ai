over the earth, cooperate with the earth, work on its
resources, and develop the wealth and prosperity of the
land.

Noble scientist, you are a co-worker with
omnipresent nature, born to defeat the proud and jealous
forces inimical to growth. Study the trishtubh verses
for knowledge and power for threefold comfort of body,
mind and soul and, flying on the wings of that
knowledge, cover the skies to explore and exploit the
resources of the sky.

Tempestuous scientist and astronaut, you are a
friend of agni, universal electric energy, born to
eliminate the failures and adversities of the internal and
external life. Study the jagati verses for the knowledge
of light and space and, on the wings of that knowledge,
reach the heavens. Cooperate with space and light
energy, cooperate with universal energy and conquer
the inner darkness with the light, and external failures
with knowledge.

Steady man of technology, you are an instrument
of eternal energy meant to serve as well as exploit the
natural resources of the environment and eliminate the
enemies who stem your growth. Go forward in and over
all the directions on the earth and around on the wings
of anushtubh verses, work with and on the currents of
wind and energy and dominate over the directions to
create one world on the earth in a healthy environment.
