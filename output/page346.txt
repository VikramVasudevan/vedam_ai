emerges in the pranic energies of nature, in the waters
and in the mind of humanity — thus illuminating and
activating everything and every mind from within. The
pious and the devout people invoke, light and worship

world, so should the ruler be. And so should he/she
vitalize and illuminate the people, and so should the
people adore him/her.)

Agni, light, energy and power of the world, let
us know the three orders of the three powers of yours
(heat, light and electricity). Lord of majesty, love and
favourite of all, let us explore and know the various
forms and places where you exist, which you support
and which support you. Let us know that supreme name
and the thing you are in the essence which is hidden in
a mysterious cave. Let us discover the spring, the water
and the cloud from where you issue forth in formal
existence (so that we may be blest with the power and
prosperity which follows the discovery and the
applications).
