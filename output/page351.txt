318 YAJURVEDA

daily pursue and achieve all the desired objects of the
world. Men of reason, intelligence and will, desirous
of wealth, choose for research and work on the cowshed
and the cloud with the rays of the sun for the realisation
of progress and prosperity.

29. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)

अस्ताव्यग्निर्नराश्डसुशेर्वोवैश्वानरऽऋषिभि: सोर्मगोपा:।
sigh द्यार्वापृथिवी र्हुवेम sat धत्त रयिमस्मे सुवीरम्॥२९॥

Astavyagnirnaram susevo vaisvanara’rsibhih
somagopah. Advese dyavaprthivi huvema deva
dhatta rayimasme suviram.

Agni, worshipped by seers and sages, is the
darling of humanity, auspicious and adorable.
Omnipresent, universal and all-commanding, it is the
guardian and promoter of the means of life, peace and
joy. We invoke the powers of earth and heaven —
powers free of hate and jealousy and sources of bliss.
Great men of the world, brilliant and generous,
guardians of the peace and prosperity of life, generate
and hold for us the wealth and power of life and polity
which creates a great nation and fearless humanity.

30. (Agni Devata, Virupaksha Rshi)

समिधाग्निं दुंवस्यत घृतैर्बोधयतार्तिथिम् ।
आस्मिंन् हव्या र्जुहोतन ॥३०॥

Samidha’gnim duvasyata ghrtairbodhayata-
tithim. Asmin havya juhotana.

(Agni is an ‘atithi’, a chance guest, which comes
at its own will whenever it comes. Serve it with the best
of offerings you have.)
