CHAPTER-XII 325

Punastva”’ditya rudra vasavah samindhatam
punarbrahmano vasunitha yajnaih. Ghrtena
tvam tanvam vardhayasva satyah santu
yajamanasya kamah.

Agni, creator and giver of wealth and honour,
may the brahmacharis and scholars of the Vasu, Rudra
and Aditya order light you up in the vedi again and
again. May the devotees of the lord of existence and
masters of the science of yajna promote your gifts with
the performance of yajna. Agni, power of light and life,
grow on in your operations with the oblations of ghee
and fragrant materials so that the plans and ambitions
of the yajamana be fulfilled.

The teachers who are old and those who are new
and the parents and other seniors who are here on the
earth, all should realise and actualise for young aspirants
the knowledge of this world. The judge of the aspirants’
performance may grant them the certificate of completion
and graduation in achievement. Hence keep away from
Adharma (injustice and untruth), go on firmly with
Dharma (truth and justice), and realise it without delay
here and now.
