CHAPTER-XII 327

It is for the love of life that I absorb the same nectar of
life into my body system. It is for the same love of life
that I hold on to my darling wife and I enjoy my food
and drink.

48. (Agni Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)
अग्ने ad fafa ae: पृथिव्यां यर्दोषधीष्वप्स्वा daa |
येनान्तरिंक्षमुर्वाततन्थं त्वेष: स भानुरर्णवो Feat: ॥४८॥

Agne yatte divi varcah prthivyam yadosadhi-
svapsva yajatra. Yenantariksamurvatatantha
tvesah sa bhanurarnavo nrcaksah.

Agni, light of the universe, life of existence,
power and presiding presence of the world, lord of yajna
and friend of the yajniks, the glory that is yours shines
in the heavens, vibrates in the earth, blooms in the herbs
and breathes in the waters. It is the same by which the
skies are pervaded and expanded. It blazes as the sun, it
rolls as the oceans of space, and it watches our human
performance as the universal eye.

(Let the scholar and the teacher attain the
knowledge of the universal spirit, nature and life in
existence and, like agni among human beings, impart the
same to his/her disciples.)

49. (Agni Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)
