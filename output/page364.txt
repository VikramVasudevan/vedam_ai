CHAPTER-XII 331

Indram visva’ avivrdhantsamudravyacasam

—--—- —-v

patim.

All the sacred voices of truth inspire and exalt
Indra, man of power and glory, wide and rolling as the
sea, supreme hero of the chariots and battles of life,
protector of truth and Dharma, and promoter of life and
its prosperity.

(The brahmacharis and brahmacharinis, who
complete their education with the sacred voice of the
Veda and the words of truth written and spoken by the
Rishis, rise in life, and when they marry in the vaidic
way, they raise families which grow in happiness and
prosperity.)

57. (Agni Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)

इषमूर्जमभि daa ion

Samitam sam kalpetham sampriyau rocisnu

sumanasyamanau. Isamurjamabhi samvasanau.

Wedded couple, two-in-one joined in love,

brilliant in health and lustre, of equal and enlightened
mind, decent and graceful in clothes and ornaments,
both of you together plan, act and realise your goal in
food, energy, prosperity, honour and glory.

58. (Agni Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)
