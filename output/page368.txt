CHAPTER-XII 335

65. (Yajamana Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)
ad देवी निर्ऋतिराबबन्ध ust tardaqarn id a
विष्याम्यार्युषो न मध्यादथैतं पितुर्मद्धि weet: । नमो भूत्यै

येदं Tea neal

Yam te devi nirrtirababandha pasam griva-
svavicrtyam. Tam te vi syamyayuso na madhyad-
athaitam pitumaddhi prasutah. Namo bhityai
yedam cakara.

Yajamana, the inexorable chain which the spirit
of adversity, in full justice, had tied round your throat
for want of yajna, I undo from the centre of your life
right away. Regenerated through yajna, eat of this holy
food. The spirit of generosity has done this miracle.
Salutations to the spirit of generosity.

66. (Agni Devata, Vishvavasu Rshi)
fash: age adat favat रूपाऽभिर्चष्टे शचींभि:।
dasa सविता सत्यधर्मेन्द्रो न deat समरे र्पथीनाम्।६६॥॥

Nivesanah sangamano vasunam visva rupa’bhi-
caste Sactbhih. Deva’iva savita satyadharmendro
na tasthau samare pathinam.

Who is a noble yajamana? A successful house-
holder (grihasthi)? The man of vitality who takes a wife,
makes a home, creates wealth and contributes to life like
Savita, the creator; who watches and illuminates all forms
of life on earth with his eyes like the sun, and manages
various developments with his acts like Indra, the leader;
who is firm in true Dharma and stands inviolable in the
battles of the pathmakers of the world — such a man is
the right yajamana and a noble house-holder.
