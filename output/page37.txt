4 YAJURVEDA

He enjoin you. He enjoins you for karma (action)
knowledge and virtue (through yajna).

7. (Yajna Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

प्रत्युष्टश्रक्ष: vebersantam Preteen Precars-
अरांतय:। Soa Rast ॥७॥

Pratyustam raksah pratyusta’ aratayo nistaptam
rakso nistapta’ aratayah. Urvantariksamanvemi.

Evil is uprooted, the selfish are eliminated. The
lawless are punished and corrected. The selfish and anti-
socials have suffered and converted. Let us be generous,
as vast as space.

8. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

धूरसि yet धूर्वन्तं धूर्व तं योऽस्मान् धूर्वति तं et यं वयं
देवहूर्तमम् ॥८॥॥

Dhurasi dhurva dhurvantam dhurva tam
yo’sman dhurvati tam dhurva yam vayam
dhurvamah. Devanamasi vahnitamam sasnita-
mam papritamam justatamam devahiutamam.

Fire of yajna, you are destroyer and preserver
both. You save by burning up the evil and the dross.
Destroy that which destroys. Destroy him who
desecrates the yajna. Destroy what our yajna burns to
destroy. To the good you are the quickest and the fieriest,
greatest purifier, giver of highest fulfilment, most
reverenced and worshipped by the good and noble
people.
