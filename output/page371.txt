338 YAJURVEDA

The plough, fitted with the share, symbol of peace
and joy, a tool of soma—plenty, prosperity and happiness
— drawn by horses or bullocks and held firmly by the
hilt, turns up the crust of the kind and generous earth to
make it ready for sowing.

72. (Mitra & others Devata, Kumaraharita Rshi)
cart कामदुघे yea fara चरुंणाय च ।
इन्द्रायाश्विभ्या पूष्णे प्रजाभ्यऽओर्षधीभ्य: ॥७२॥

Kamam kamadughe dhuksva mitraya varunaya
ca. Indrayasvibhyam pusne prajabhya’
osadhibhyah.

Mother of fulfilment and source of satisfaction,
generous earth/furrow of the field/holy cow, let the desires
be fulfilled for friends, noble scholars and guests,
persons of power and glory, the people, powers of health
and pranic energies, and for the growth of herbs and
trees.

73. (Aghnya Devata, Kumaraharita Rshi)

विर्मुच्यध्वमघ्न्या देवयानाऽअर्गन्म तर्मसस्पारमस्य |
ज्योतिरापाम ॥७३॥

Vimucyadhvamaghnya devayana’aganma

Be free from poverty, ill-health and ignorance.
Let us be rich with the holy inviolable cows for
nourishment and prosperity. May we cross this darkness
and attain to the light of the sun and the glory of life.
