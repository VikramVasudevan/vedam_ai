6 YAJURVEDA

Bhutaya tva nardtaye svarabhivikhyesam
drimhantam duryah prthivyamurvantariksa-
manvemi. Prthivyastva nabhau sadayamyaditya’
upasthe’gne havyam raksa.

I set the vedi of yajna on the navel of the earth
and in the centre of the sky for the prosperity of living
beings and eradication of poverty and selfishness. Open
the doors of the homes on earth and let us rise to the
sky for visions of heavenly bliss. Lord of yajna, Agni,
protect our yajna and the holy materials for oblations.

12. (Ap-Savita Devate, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

पवित्रें स्थो caret सवितुर्ब: waa scaratessur
पवित्रेंण सूर्यस्य रश्मिर्भि: । देवींरापोऽअग्रेगुवोऽअग्रेपुवोऽ-
ग्रऽड्डममद्य यज्ञं daa यज्ञर्पति: सुधार्तुं यज्ञर्पतिं देव-
युर्वम् ॥१२॥

Pavitre stho vaisnavyau saviturvah prasava
utpunamyacchidrena pavitrena suryasya
rasmibhih. Devirapo’ agreguvo’ agrepuvo’gra’
imamadya yajnam nayatagre yajnapatim
sudhatum yajnapatim devayuvam.

In this cosmic yajna of Lord Savita, holy fire and
wind are two carriers of yajna, sanctified by the ceaseless
showers of the purest rays of the sun. The holy waters
electrified by the sun, raised by the fire and carried by
the wind travel through space and sky and shower on
the earth to feed the growth of life. May the same divine
rays of the sun, fire and wind, and the holy water carry
the yajna ever forward, and may these and the yajna
bless the yajnapati to move ever onward with health,
wealth and noble virtue.
