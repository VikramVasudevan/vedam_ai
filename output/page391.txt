358 YAJURVEDA

CHAPTER -XIII

1. (Agni Devata, Vatsara Rshi)

मामुं देवर्तां: सचन्ताम् ॥१॥

Mayi grhnamyagre’agniin rayasposaya supraja-
stvaya suviryaya. Mamu devatah sacantam.

First of all I dedicate my mind and soul to the
Lord Almighty, Agni, lord of light and life, power and
prosperity, and I instal the yajna-fire in my home for
the gifts of vigour and valour, wealth and prosperity
and a noble family. May all the divine powers, for sure,
favour and bless me.

(Just as a house-holder or a student is dedicated
to Agni, the Lord Almighty, and to agni, the yajna-fire,
so too should he/she be dedicated to the agnis among
the community, leading men and women of knowledge,
wisdom and virtue who have specialised in various
fields of knowledge and development.)

2. (Agni Devata, Vatsara Rshi)

Apam prsthamasi yoniragneh samudramabhitah

divo matraya varimna prathasva.

Lord Almighty, infinite spirit and life of the
universe, you are the centre-hold of waters and energy.
