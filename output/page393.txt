360 YAJURVEDA

Hiranyagarbhah samavartatagre bhitasya jatah
patireka’asit. Sa dadhara prthivim dyamutemam
kasmai devaya havisa vidhema.

The One Lord of Light and the sole creator of
lights such as the sun existed before creation (as He
ever exists). He alone was and is the lord and sustainer
of all forms of created being. He holds and sustains the
earth and heaven and supports this whole universe. We
worship the same one lord and offer Him homage with
libations of fragrant materials.

Drapsascaskanda prthivimanu dyamimam ca
yonimanu yasca purvah. Samanam yonimanu
sancarantam drapsam juhomyanu sapta hotrah.

That eternal, perfect and primordial joy (Ananda)
which blesses and coexists with the earth, the heaven
and the original cause of existence, Prakriti, the same
joy which universally subsists with its origin, the sole
creator, I adore with all my breath of life (five pranas),
mind and soul.

6. (Hiranyagarbha Devata, Hiranyagarbha Rshi)

For all those that move in space, and those which
move on the earth, which move in the regions of heaven
