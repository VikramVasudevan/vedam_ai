CHAPTER -XIII 367

fully protect and support you in every way for all the
energy of life, prevention of suffering, best manners
and behaviour, inner strength, dignity and recognition
and virtuous conduct. In a state of perfect peace and
well-being, with all the joys of life in a good home, stay
firm and secure with Agni, the lord of life, and your
husband, like Prakriti with Purusha and the light of the
dawn with the day.

20. (Patni Devata, Agni Rshi)

काण्डांत्काण्डात्प्ररोर्हन्ती wea: परुषस्परिं |
vat नों दूर्वे प्रतनु सहस्रेंण West च Roll

Kandat kandat prarohanti parusah parusaspari.
Eva no diurve pra tanu sahasrena Satena ca.

Lady of the home, delicate and graceful as the
durva grass, just as the grass grows from one section of
the stalk to another, from one knot of joint to another,
so you too, grow in life, and let us grow and help us
advance in life a hundred-fold and from thereon a
thousand fold.

21. (Patni Devata, Agni Rshi)

या शतेर्न waft aeetor विरोर्हसि ।
तस्यास्ते देवीष्टके fast हविर्षां वयम् een

Ya Satena pratanosi sahasrena virohasi.
Tasyaste devistake vidhema havisa vayam.

Lady light of the home, root and foundation of
the yajna of family life, as you grow a hundred-fold
and then you rise a thousand-fold, O noble and generous
mother, we offer you love and reverence in homage with
the best fragrant offerings.
