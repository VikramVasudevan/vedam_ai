374 YAJURVEDA

Behold the great acts of the omnipresent lord of
the universe, Vishnu, acts like the creation, sustenance
and dissolution of the world. Therein I see the essence,
the ultimate blueprint of the discipline and actions for
living. He is the great friend and lover of the human
soul. He is the giver of bliss.

34, (Jataveda Devata, Gotama Rshi)

gat धरुणेतो sia प्रथममेभ्यो योर्निभ्योऽअर्धि जात-
वेंदा:। स र्गायत्र्या त्रिष्टुर्भानुष्टुभां च देवेभ्भ्यों get deq
प्रजानन् ॥३४॥

Dhruvasi dharuneto jajne prathamamebhyo
yonibhyo’ adhi jatavedah. Sa gayatrya
tristubhanustubha ca devebhyo havyam vahatu
prajanan.

Mother of the universe, Prakriti, firm and
inviolable power, bearer of the world’s forms in
existence as you are, it was through your oceanic womb
that Agni, the omniscient creative consciousness first
manifested Itself. And He, knowing and manifesting
through everything born, moved the materials of the
cosmic yajna to the evolutionary powers of nature and
communicated the cosmic knowledge through gayatri,
trishtup and anushtup verses to the visionary sages.

(In the context of the home, grihastha, the wife is
the Prakriti-like centre-hold of the organisation and the
mother of the familial creation. The husband is agni,
jataveda, father and yajamana of the home-yajna.)

35. (Jataveda Devata, Gotama Rshi)

इषे wa रमस्व weed द्युम्नऽऊर्जेऽअर्पत्याय |
सम्रार्डसि स्वरार्डसि सारस्वतौ त्वोत्सौ प्रार्वताम् BG
