876 YAJURVEDA
on the chariot.
38. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)

सम्यक Gata सरितो न धेरनांऽअन्तर्हृदा मर्नसा पूयमांना:।
च्चतस्य धारांऽअभिर्चांकशीमि हिरण्ययो वेतसो weats-
aT: BEN

Samyak sravanti sarito na dhena’ antarhrda
manasa puyamanah. Ghrtasya dhara’ abhi
cakaSimi hiranyayo vetaso madhye’ agneh.

Like streams, soft, sweet and ceaseless glides the
flow of words distilled and purified by the heart and
mind within. And I, wrapped in gold, in the midst of
the light and fire of Agni, turned to a flute of reed, hear
the murmur of the showers of benediction.

39. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)

wa wat रुचे cat भासे त्वा ज्योर्तिषे त्वा 1 अभूदिदं
विशर्वस्य भुर्वनस्य वार्जिनमग्नेर्वैश्वानरस्यं च seu

Ree tva ruce tva bhase tva jyotise tva. Abhudidam
visvasya bhuvanasya vajinam agnervaisva-
narasya ca.

To you Agni, lord of knowledge and speech,
thanks and salutations for the knowledge of truth, love
and lustre of life, light of science, and brilliance of
justice and rectitude! By virtue of you alone, this soul
has become aware of the entire world and of the
universal presence of agni, the vital energy of life and
nature active in the earthly sphere. By virtue of Agni
alone this scholar and teacher can propagate this
knowledge of reality among the people around.
