The unborn individual soul was born in this world
from the flame of the Supreme Lord’s cosmic yajna of
creation. It grew conscious and had a vision of the
creator right there. By virtue of the vision and grace of
the Lord, the pious souls, purified by the vision, realise
the divine powers and rise to the heights of existence.
Agni, noble ruler/noble man, I point out to the wild
sharabha (fabulous antelope of the snowy forest,
mightier than the lion and the elephant). Like that,
defend yourself and grow, and growing thereby, be
happy and feel satisfied and settled by yourself. Let your
concern address the sharabha. Let your concern be
directed to those who hurt us.
