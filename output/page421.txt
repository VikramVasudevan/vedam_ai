In the west (on the back) this sun is the divine
power that illuminates and covers the whole world with
light. The offspring of the sun is the light and the vision
of the eye. The product of light and heat is the rain. The
joy of rain is expressed in the jagati verse. In jagati metre
are composed the Rik-samans. From the joy of Rik-
Samans is born ‘shukra’, the lustre and vitality of life.
From shukra is born the sapta-dasha (seventeen) stoma
and the seventeen faculty subtle body. From this
seventeen-element living life is born the diversity of
living forms, of which the seer and visionary expert is
jamadagni, man of light and lustre.

Woman of knowledge, virtue and love blest by
Prajapati, along with you I receive light and vision for
family and the people.
