CHAPTER-XIII 389

Idamuttarat svastasya srotrain sauvain Sara-

On the north is this spirit of bliss and joy. The
instrument of joy is the ear, and sharad, autumn, is the
season for ear and music. The metre for sharad is
anushtup. In anushtup 18 composed the aida-saman
which is the song of beauty and sweetness. From aida
is the ‘manthi’, churner, who churns out hilarity and
virility. From manthis comes the twenty-one part stoma
which constitutes an integrated programme of twenty
one branches of learning. From twenty one stoma comes
vairaja saman, a body of knowledge, of which the seer-
master is Vishwamitra, friend of the whole world.

Woman of knowledge, virtue and love, blest by
Prajapati, alongwith you I receive the ear and the voice
that gives me the songs of joy and virility for the sake
of the family and the community.
