390 YAJURVEDA

Up above is this intelligence. From intelligence
and for it is speech. With speech goes the season of
‘hemanta’, winter, and pankti is the metre for hemanta.
Nidhanavat, the choric finale of a saman about hemanta,
winter-song, is composed in pankti metre. From
nidhanavat, the finale, is born the agrayana, first soma
libation in agnishtoma yajna for the attainment of plenty
of wealth and knowledge. From agrayana, there are
twelve and thirty three saman hymns of praise. From
these twelve and thirty three, we have shakvara and
rewata, means to wealth, honour and power. The person
who is an expert visionary of these hymns is a master
of all arts and actions leading to wealth, power and
honour.

Woman of knowledge, virtue and love, blest by
Prajapati, alongwith you I receive the gift of speech
(knowledge, wisdom and expertise) for the sake of
children, family and the community.
