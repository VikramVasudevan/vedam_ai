CHAPTER-XIV 401

May Vishwakarma, lord maker of the world/your
husband, seat you firmly on top of the sky. Do not
pollute, do not injure, the sky. Growing expansive,
encompassing, enrich the sky, strengthen the sky for
the sake of prana, apana, vyana and udana energy, and
for honour and strength of character.

May Vayu, wind and universal energy/your
husband, protect and promote you in all ways with great
good fortune, light, peace and well-being. Stay firm with
that divine power like the breath of life.

You are the mistress of the rising light of the east.
You are the lady of universal light of the south direction.
You are the noble and peaceful power of light in the
west. You are the self-refulgent light of the north. You
are the great lady of the top and foundation of the home-
land, the great sustaining mother earth of the family.
