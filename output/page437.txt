404 YAJURVEDA

each according to its own law and function, be
favourable to us for the gift of excellence. May all the
vital fires in earth and heaven, integrated and
harmonious, energizing the months of autumn like
powers of nature serving the Lord, Indra, bless and
vitalize us in all ways.

Just as heaven and earth abide by God, as autumn
abides by agni, so should we abide by the Lord, nature
and autumn like life with breath, Prakriti with Purusha
and part with the whole.

Light and Law of the Universe, protect my life.
Energize my breath. Clear and strengthen my cleansing
system and eliminate the wastes. Strengthen the

my eye. Protect and sensitize my ear. Guard and enliven
my speech. Regenerate and broaden my mind. Save and
strengthen my soul. Give me light, give me the light to
see and realize.
