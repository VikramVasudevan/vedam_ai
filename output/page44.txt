CHAPTER-I val

Yajna is the source of joy, it is joy itself. Evil is
eliminated, selfishness is eliminated. It is the protective
cover of the earth. Let the children of the earth know
this. The chant is the voice of omniscience. It is the
light of heaven and main-stay of the stars. The chant is
the music of the showers and the thunder of the clouds.
Let the children of the earth know, let the beneficiaries
of heaven know and realize.

20. (Savita Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)
धान्य्रमसि धिनुहि देवान् wore त्वोदानार्यं त्वा व्यानार्यं

हिरंण्यपाणि: प्रतिंगृभ्णात्वच्छिद्रेण पाणिना चक्षुषे त्वा
महीनां पर्योऽसि।॥२०॥

It is food consecrated by yajna, water purified by
yajna. It is food for the gods, our body, senses, mind
and soul. Take it for strength and energy, for smartness
and vitality, for virtue and action toward a long and full
life. May the Lord Savita, with His unstinted and
generous hand, bless us with the gifts of light and life
on the earth in abundance.

र्जर्गतीभि: Gerdes सं मर्धुमतीर्मर्धुमतीभि: पृच्यन्ताम् ॥२१॥
