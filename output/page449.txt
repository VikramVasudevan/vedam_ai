416 YAJURVEDA

With thirtyone parts and properties of the created
world of nature, worship Him who created the elemental
and the compound materials of nature and life with these
very elements and forms being the presiding presences
of existence.

With thirty three properties of the elements of
nature, worship Him in whose creation Prajapati, the
father of His creatures, is the Supreme Lord, and into
whom all the forms and elements of existence recede in
peace and silence for the night of annihilation.
