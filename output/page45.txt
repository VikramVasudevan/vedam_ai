12 YAJURVEDA

Devasya tva savituh prasave’svinorbahubhyam
pusno hastabhyam. Sam vapami samapa’
*osadhibhith samosadhayo rasena. Sam revatir-
jagatibhih prcyantam sam madhumatir-madhu-
matibhih preyantam.

With the joint action of the light of the sun and
the vital warmth of the earth, and with the up and down
movement of the breath of air, I carry on a triple yajna
in this creation of Lord Savita. The waters join and

and the soothing herbs with the honey-sweet juices. The
yajna goes on. Keep it up and on for the sake of life and
good health.
