Movement is life. Knowledge is thrill. Excellence
is great, truth is excellence. Peace is great. Self mastery
is sovereignty. Industry is prosperity. Protection against
evil is security. Mind and thought is light. Generosity
is exhilarating. Fluidity is majesty. Magnanimity,
liquidity and transparency is gentleness. Universal
reputation is honour. Divine knowledge, noble
performance and honest prayer is glory. Poetry is
ecstasy. Straight behaviour like liquid movement is
satisfaction. The path to eternity is bliss. The way of
the world is joy. The directions of space are exciting.
The razor’s edge is the challenge of life. The splendour
of existence is rapture.
