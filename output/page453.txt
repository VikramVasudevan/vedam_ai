Prevention of evil is light. Fight against evil is
courage. Self-control is bravery. Variety of choice is
versatility. Ascendancy to the heavens is freedom. The
path to success is the right choice. The windfalls of
attainment are lovely. Meditation on the sky reveals the
bonds of piety. Voice is revelation. Light is illumination.
Speech is expression of word, meaning and reality.
Thought is reflection on meaning and reality. Effort and
achievement on earth is meaningful. Excellence is
valuable. Life is a boon. The life-force is irresistible.
Emulation and competition is legitimate. Great action
is glory. Cover and protection is nobility. Rising against
difficulty is perseverance. Freedom is the breath of life.
Faith and ascertainment is inviolable joy.
