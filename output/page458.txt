May this lord of yours and the Lord sustainer of
the world and all those powers who know, together in
unison, establish you and the yajamana on the heights
of the heavenly regions of bliss.

You are the reigning lady of light like the South
direction. All the Rudra powers of love and justice are
your divine protectors. Indra, lord of power and the
thunderbolt, keeps off your adversaries. May the
Panchadasha (fifteen part) stoma of Rks settle you on
the earth. May the Pre-uga Uktha hymns firmly secure
you against fear and disturbance. May the Brihat-Sama
hymns and karma extend your honour to the skies. May
the foremost Rshis, saints and scholars spread your
honour and fame with the measure of your heavenly
excellence among the noblest people.
