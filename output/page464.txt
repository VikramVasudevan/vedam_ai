CHAPTER-XV 431

all those we oppose, we deliver unto the judgement of
the powers of defence and the Spirit of nature.

At the back in the West is this rain power of Agni,
universal electric energy. Like a king’s commander of
the forces and the chief of his city, are the two months
of rain, Shravana and Bhadrapada, with the charming
beauty of the clouds and the awful majesty of lightning.
The power to nourish the vegetation and the ripening
touch to the crops are the two currents of its energy.

Mordacious animals such as the tiger are
dangerous. Creatures such as the snake are still more
dangerous. Against them the thunderbolt for defence
and man-made plans.

May the powers of safety and defence save us.
May they be good and kind to us. All those that violate
our life and all those we oppose, we deliver unto the
judgement of the powers of defence and the spirit of
nature.
