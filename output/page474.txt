CHAPTER-XV 441

Bhadro no’agnirahuto bhadra ratih subhaga
bhadro’ adhvarah. Bhadra’ uta prasastayah.

Man of grace and yajna, may the Agni, invoked
and raised, be gracious. May the oblations, charities and
investments be positive and productive. May our yajna
and creative ventures be constructive and fruitful. May
our appreciations and appraisals be valuable and
enlightening.

39. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)

येनां aaed सासर्ह: ॥३९॥

Bhadra’uta prasastayo bhadram manah krnusva
vrtraturye. Yena samatsu sasahah.

Man of knowledge, expertise and grace, may all
our projects and appraisals be favourable. Do your best
so that in our battles against covers of darkness and
evil our mind be firm and undisturbed, and then in our
battles of life we may endure and be victorious at the
end.

40. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)

amt समत्सुं सासहोऽर्व स्थिरा cafe भूरि शार्धताम् |
वनेमां तेऽअभिष्टिभि: ison

Yena samatsu sasaho’ va sthira tanuhi bhuri
Sardhatam. Vanema te’ abhistibhih.

The spirit by which the forces endure in battles
and win, with that spirit strengthen and expand to the
full our forces and powers so that we grow firm and
inviolable. May we benefit from your gracious gifts,
win our battles and enjoy in life.
