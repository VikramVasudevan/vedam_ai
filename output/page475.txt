442 YAJURVEDA

41. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
अग्निं तं Ha यो वसुरस्तं यं afd धेनर्व: | अस्तमर्वन्तऽ-
आशवोऽस्तं Freatar वाजिनऽइर्षश्रंस्तोतभ्यऽआ AT ॥४१॥

Agnim tam manye yo vasurastam yam yanti
dhenavah. Astamarvanta’asavo’ stam nityaso
vajina’ isain stotrbhya’ a bhara.

I know the Agni that is the hearth and home of
existence. Homeward go the cows. The fastest coursers
betake to home. The hero, the chariot, the feathered
eagle, the stallion, all go home to rest without fail, all
by nature. That is the home for me.

That same Agni, mother of the home for all, is
the ultimate haven. Mother mine, keep for the yajnic
children food for life, energy for action, and light for
the life divine.

42. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
सोऽअग्निर्यो ager सं यमायन्तिं धेनर्व: 1 समर्वन्तो
रघुद्रुव: USAT: सूरयऽइर्षश्रंस्तोतृभ्यऽआ AL ॥४२॥

So’agniryo vasurgrne sam yamayanti dhenavah.
Samarvanto raghudruvah sam sujatasah suraya
*isam stotrbhya ’a bhara.

Agni is that who is the treasure, home and haven
for all in existence. Him I celebrate in song. In Him the
words of song find their meaning. Saints of wisdom,
geniuses of science most responsive, men of vision most
fortunately born, all have their recourse there. Lord of
light and life, bear and bring the food, release the energy,
and reveal the light of divinity for the celebrants.
