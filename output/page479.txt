446 YAJURVEDA

attain to the lord.

Lord most blazing, power of splendour and
majesty as you are, we pray to you, in faith, for peace
and prosperity for ourselves and all our friends.

49. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
येनऽॠऋर्षयस्तर्पसा सत्रमायन्निन्धानाऽअग्निश्रस्वराभरन्त: ।
तस्मिंन्नहं निर्दधे नार्केऽअग्नि यमाहुर्मर्नव स्तीर्ण-
SET ise

Yena’ rsayastapasa satramayannindhana’
agnim svarabharantah. Tasminnaham ni dadhe
nake ’agnim yamahurmanava stirnabarhisam.

By the austerity of discipline and action the seers
come to the sessions of yajna and, lighting and exploring
the agni, attain to ages of joy and happiness. By the
same discipline, in similar session, at the same level of
blissful existence, I commit myself to the pursuit of the
same agni which people say pervades the skies.

50. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)

तं ucdittieieean dar: qautditea वा हिरंण्यै: |
Tea: ॥७०॥

Tam patnibhiranu gacchema devah putrair-
bhratrbhiruta va hiranyaih. Nakam grbhnanah
sukrtasya loke trtiye prsthe’adhi rocane divah.

Powers of light and joy, dedicating ourselves in
prayer and action to the same Agni, may we attain to
the highest and most beloved region of the beautiful
world of bliss and noble pursuits with our wives,
children, brothers and all our wealth and prosperity.
