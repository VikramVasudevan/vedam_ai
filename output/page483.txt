Margashirsha and Phalguna (January-February
and February-March) are the months of winter season,
cold, cool and pleasant. You are the lovely warmth of
the inner-most heart of Agni’s fire.

May the heaven and earth be auspicious, may the
waters be fresh and invigorating, may the herbs and trees
be revitalized and rejuvenating, may all the modes of
fire, heat, light, lightning, etc., each committed and
constant in its quality and character, be favourable and
blissful to me for growth in excellence.

May all the vital fires abiding in earth and heaven,
integrated and harmonious, supporting and energizing
the months of the winter season like the powers of nature
serving the omnipotent lord, Indra, bless and vitalize
us in all ways.

Man of yajna and lady of the house of yajna, both
of you joining the months of the season be firm and
stay fast with the lord of nature as breath and life
together.
