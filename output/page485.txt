Agni, ruler of the land, just as a horse arises eager
for the grass, so whenever you are challenged, you arise
from a state of deep peace and, determined for the
protection of your people, stand firm and unshakable.
Your clarion call and your brilliance rallies the people
round and, electrified, they follow you in every
movement.
