CHAPTER-XVI 457

Rudra, lord of life, chief advisor and divine
physician, speak to us on matters of health and,
destroying all the snake-like deadly germs and viruses,
root out all the debilitating and fatal diseases.

6. (Rudra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)
असौ aenissteurssa ay: सुंमङ्गर्ल: । ये चैनश्रुद्राऽ-
अभिर्तो दिक्षु श्रिता: र्सहस्त्रशोऽर्वैषाश्टंहेर्डऽईमहे gu

Asau yastamro’aruna’uta babhruh sumangalah
Ye cainam rudra’abhito diksu Sritah sahasraso’-
vaisain heda’imahe.

And the sun which is copper red, bright red and
reddish brown (in the morning, in the day and toward
the evening) is auspicious and efficacious. And the
thousands of heavenly bodies, planets and satellites, etc.,
sustained around in all the directions, we pray, be good
and protective for all of us.

7. (Rudra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)
असौ योंऽवसर्प`ति नीर्लग्रीवो वित्नोंहित: । set गोपाऽ-
अदृश्रन्नदुं श्रन्नुदहार्यु: स get र्मडयाति a: ॥७॥

Asau yo’vsarpati nilagrivo vilohitah. Utainam
gopa’ adrsrannadrsrannudaharyah sa drsto
mrdayati nah.

And the sun which is descending dark-necked
behind the clouds like a peacock and reddish toward
the evening is auspicious and efficacious. The cowherds
see it, the water-carriers see it, and seen thus it acts as a
healing power for us.
