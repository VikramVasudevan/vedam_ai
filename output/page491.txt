458 YAJURVEDA

8. (Rudra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

नरमोंऽस्तु नीर्लग्रीवाय ureter मीढुर्षे ।
star asst स्त्वानोऽहं तेर्भश्योऽकरं AA: eu

Namo’stu nilagrivaya sahasraksaya midhuse.
Atho ye’asya satvano’ham tebhyo’karam
namah.

Salutations to the blue-necked power of the
healing sun. Salutations to the lord of the light of a
thousand eyes. Salutation to the lord of the rain showers
of health. And to those powers, too, which are floating
around as planets and satellites bearing the essence of
its healing power, we offer our salutations in homage.

9. (Rudra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

प्रर्मुञ्च eradaeaqyanieai rary ।
aed ते हस्तऽडर्षव: परा ता wat वप ॥९॥
Pramunca dhanvanastvamubhayorartnyorjyam.
Yasca te hasta’isavah para ta bhagavo vapa.

Glorious lord of power and defence, stretch and
release the string at the two ends of the bow and shoot
the arrows which are in your hand at the target yonder.

10. (Rudra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)
fai et: कपर्दिनो विल्यो बार्णवाँ २॥ऽउत |
अनेशन्नस्य याऽइर्षवऽआभुरंस्य निषङ्गधि: ॥१०॥
Vijyvam dhanuh kapardino visalyo banavan’ uta.
Anesnnasya ya’isava’abhurasya nisangadhih.
May the awful bow of the lord of braided hair
never be without the string. May his arrows never be

without the point. May his arms be never destroyed.
May his armoury never be void of arms.
