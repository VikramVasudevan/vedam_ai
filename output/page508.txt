Salutations to the lord across the river, and to
him this side of the flow. And salutations to the captain
who steers all across the seas, and to him who steers
across and above. And salutations to him who is both
the guide and the goal and to him who awaits us on the
shore. And salutations to him who shines green in
vegetation, and to him who floats with the foam.

च WOT च ॥४३॥

Namah sikatyaya ca pravahyaya ca namah
kimnsilaya ca ksayanaya ca namah kapardine ca
pulastaye ca nama ’irinyaya ca prapathyaya ca.

Homage to the gold in the sand, and to him who
flows with the flow. And homage to him who plays with
the pebbles, and to him who dwells in the tranquil
harbour. Homage to the lord of the braided hair and to
him who shines with glossy hair. Homage to the lord of
the desert and to the protector of the wandering sages.
