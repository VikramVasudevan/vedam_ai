Sa’isuhastaih sa nisangibhirvasi sainsrasta sa

That warrior, router of the enemy, Indra, self-
controlled, lover of exhilarating soma and defender of
peace, creator and commander of the army, strong of
arm, wielder of mighty weapons and awful marksman,
supported by his well-selected and well-deployed army
highly equipped with arms and armaments, defeats the
collective forces of the enemies.

Brhaspate pari diya rathena raksoha ’mitran’
apabadhamanah. Prabhanjantsenah pramrno

Brihaspati, commander of the mighty army,
destroyer of the wicked, repulsing the enemy, routing
his force and causing havoc all round by your chariot,
you come out victorious over the violent and the evil in
the battle. Be the protector and defender of our chariots
and the wheels of the nation’s economy.
