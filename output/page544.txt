Udu tva visve deva’agne bharantu cittibhih. Sa

Agni, lord of power and glory, may all the noble
people of the land with their heart and soul accept,
approve, support and raise you to the heights. And you
too, so high and noble, a very image of nobility and
magnanimity, be good and kind to us.

54. (Disha directions Devata, Apratiratha Rshi)

SATA USI

Panca diso daiviryajnamavantu devirapamatim
durmatim badhamanah. Rayaspose yajnapati-
mabhajanti rayaspose’adhi yajno’asthdat.

May all the five directions of space replete with
the celestial generosity of nature protect and promote
yajna. May the intelligent and pious women,
brahmacharinis and wives of saints and scholars,
preventing and dispelling ignorance and evil gentus,
supporting and serving the yajnapati in the growth of
health and wealth, protect and promote yajna in the
household.

May the yajna and the household be established
in good health, wealth and progress in well-being.
