CHAPTER-XVII 515

Wider than oceans of space, supreme over the
commanding and blissful powers of existence, lord
sustainer of the universal energies and nourishments,
lord ordainer of the truth and reality of the world and
Himself the supreme reality, all the voices of nature,
humanity and divinity celebrate the only one omnipotent
sovereign power, Indra.

62. (Yajna Devata, Vidhriti Rshi)

देवहूर्यज्ञऽआ चं वक्षत्सुम्नहूर्यज्ञऽआ at वक्षत् |
यर्क्षदग्निर्देवो देवाँ२॥ऽआ चच वक्षत् use

Devahuryajna’a ca vaksat sumnahuryajna’a ca

Yajna is the divine power which calls forth the
noblest powers and people to the congregation. May it
raise the voice of truth and give us the divine message
and save us from untruth. Yajna stimulates life with
pleasure and well-being. May it inspire us with pleasure
and well-being. The fire of yajna and the lord of light
feeds the powers of nature. May it augment and enrich
the treasures of the environment and bless us with the
same divine gifts.
