life. Fill the sky with light. [I}uminate the heaven with
light and glory. Enrich the directions of space with life

Ajuhvanah supratikah purastadagne svam

adhyuttarasmin visve deva yajamanasca sidata.

Agni, lord of light and life, invoked and invited
in yajna, splendid and gracious in form, come and settle
in your own seat in front, in the east. The yajamana and
all the noble souls may sit and grace this home now as
well as later. May Agni shower divine grace upon us,
the yajamana, and all the noble souls in this life and
hereafter.

गाम् ॥७४॥

Tam saviturvarenyasya citrama’ham vrne
sumatim visvajanyam. Yamasya kanvo aduhat-
prapinam sahasradharam payasa mahim gam.

I dedicate myself to this chosen Lord Savita’s
rich, generous and wonderful divine intelligence which
gives a thousand showers of universal knowledge and
which the man of vision distils from the mother
knowledge of the Vedas just like milk from the great
mother cow.
