580 YAJURVEDA

Tridha hitam panibhirguhyamdanam gavi devaso
ghrtamanvavindan. Indra’ ekam surya’ ekam
jajana vendadekain svadhaya nistataksuh.

The mystique of yajna/ghee/waters, three-way
hidden and three-way studied in quietude by
knowledgeable people, the visionaries sought and found
it in the cow, the Veda and nature. One was found and
revealed by Indra, specialist of electric energy, one by
the specialist of solar energy, and one was received from
the scholars of the Vedas and enacted with oblations by
the devotees of yajna.

93. (YajnaPurusha Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)

uasattta galegqgresacdsr रिपुणा नावचक्षे ।
garda धारांऽअभिचांकशीमि हिरण्यर्यो वेतसो मर्ध्यऽ-
आसाम् ॥९३॥

Eta’arsanti hrdyat samudracchatavraja ripuna
navacakse. Ghrtasya dhara’abhicakasimi
hiranyayo vetaso madhya’asam.

These waves of cosmic energy, these vibrations
of the cosmic boom of the Word, issue from the oceanic
depths of the Eternal Mind. In countless streams they
flow all round, not even an enemy can deny them. And
I, a soul wrapped in golden hue, stand in the midst of
these waves like a reed and feel the power and the
beatitude blowing through me.

94. (YajnaPurusha Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)

सम्यक Gata सरितो न धेनांऽअन्तर्हृदा मर्नसा पूयर्माना:।
एतेऽरअर्षन्त्यूर्मर्यो geet मृगाऽईव झक्षिपणोरीर्षमाणा: ॥९४॥
Samyak sravanti sarito na dhena’antarhrda
manasa puyamanah. Ete’arsantyurmayo
ghrtasya mrga’iva ksipanorisamanah.
