is mine, the dynamic world is mine and the sense of
change is mine, the wealth is mine and the sense of
value is mine, all life is mine and all its opportunities
are mine, glory is mine and the respect for glory is mine,
fun is mine and games are mine, joy of the world is
mine and the freedom of liberation is mine, all that is
born is mine and I am for it, all that is being created is
for me and I am for it, all that will be created will be for
me and I shall be for it, all that has been said well is for
me and । am for it, all that has been well done is for me
and I am for it, all these and all my good words, thoughts
and deeds may grow and be firm and favourable for me
and for all by virtue of yajna.
