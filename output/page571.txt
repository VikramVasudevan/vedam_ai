588 YAJURVEDA

my immortal spirit and meditation, my freedom from
illness and exercise, my freedom from suffering and
my medication, my vitality and tonics, my longevity
and yoga, my freedom from enmity and love for all, my
freedom from fear and self-confidence, my joy and
means of comfort, my sleep and freedom from tension,
my beautiful dawn and early prayers, my happy day and
good fortune, may all these grow, be firm and favourable
for all and for me by yajna, corporate action and the
Grace of God.

7. (Prajapati Devata, Devas Rshis)
यन्ता चं मे धर्ता d मे क्षेर्मश्च a धृतिंश्च मे feed च
मे महंश्च मे संविर्च्च मे at च मे सूश्चं मे aged मे

Yanta ca me dharta came ksemasca me dhrtisca
me visvam ca me mahasca me samvicca me
jnatram ca me susca me prasuca me stram ca
me layasSca me yajnena kalpantam.

My ruler and my observance of the rules, my
sustainer and supports, my security and the protector,
my constancy and self-protection, my world around and
my behaviour, my nobility and noble actions, my
awareness and self-knowledge, my field of
specialisation and my achievement, my inspiration and
initiative, my potency of generation and my children,
my agriculture and the farmers, my house and my
property, all these may grow, be strong and firm and
good and auspicious for me and for all by yajna, personal
endeavour, corporate action and the Grace of God.
