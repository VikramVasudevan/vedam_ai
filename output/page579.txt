the operations of mother Prakriti grow strong and firm
and be good and auspicious for me and all by yajna, the
process of replenishment, renewal and enrichment.

The pervasive sun and its light, and the foods
ripened by the sun rays, the fearless man and the
protector of the law-abiding, and the presiding power
and the office thereof, and my holy-chant in meditation
and concentration on the secrets of mysteries, my mid-
breath and inner strength, my vital heat that controls
the winds and electric currents of the body system and
the water, the pranic vitality related to prana and udana
(breath and the upper motions of energy wind), and the
inner light between the solar and the lunar plexi and its
effects on health, and the energy for movement and my
movements, and my purity of mind and vital energy,
and my churner and dairy foods and apparatuses, may
all these grow strong and be good and auspicious for
me and for all by yajna.
