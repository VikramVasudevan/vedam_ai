552 YAJURVEDA
for me and for all:

Four is mine, and four is mine, eight is mine. Eight
is mine, and four, twelve is mine. Twelve is mine, plus
four, sixteen is mine. Sixteen is mine, add four, and
twenty is mine. Twenty is mine, and twenty four is mine.
Twenty four is mine, and twenty eight is mine. Twenty
eight is mine and thirty two is mine. Thirty two is mine,
and thirty six is mine. Thirty six is mine, and forty is
mine. Forty is mine, and forty four is mine. Forty four
is mine, and forth eight is mine. And so on the numbers
may increase till infinity by yajna, for me and for all for
the good of life and joy.

Also: By implication, the mantra can be applied
to the process of yajna by ‘dana’, gifting away,
subtraction, by four, from forty-eight down to four and
sO on.

The mantra can also be applied to the process of
multiplication. In fact, the mantra itself gives the
multiplication table upto twelve times four and so on.

So too the mantra may be interpreted as showing
the process of division since it gives a table of the
division of forty eight by four upto twelve times.
