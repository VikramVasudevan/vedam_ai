children and young people. By virtue of the same food
and power, may I, producer and promoter of food,
energy and wealth, attain all my hopes to fruition in all
directions.

34. (Annapati Devata, Devas Rshis)

ant: पुरस्तादुत र्मध्यतो नो anit देवान् हविषषां वर्द्धयाति।
art हि मा सर्व`वीरं wer सर्वाऽआशा वार्जपति-
र्भवेयम् uss

Vajah purastaduta madhyato no vajo devan
havisa vardhayati. Vajo hi ma sarvaviram
cakara sarva’asa vajapatirbhaveyam.

Food with oblations in yajna takes us forward in
the beginning and in the middle of home life. With
oblations it feeds and enriches the powers of nature and
the noblest people too. It is food which blesses me with
the best and the bravest powers and people everywhere.
I pray I may be the producer, promoter and protector of
food in all directions and realize all my hopes and
ambitions.

35. (Rasavidyavid vidvan Devata, Devas Rshis)

सं मां सृजामि पर्यसा पृथिव्या: सं at सृजाम्यद्धिरोर्ष-
ent: 1 aise वार्जश्सनेयमग्ने ae

Sam ma srjami payasa prthivyah sam ma
srjamyadbhirosadhibhih. So’ham vajain
saneyamagne.

Agni, I invigorate and enrich myself with the milk
and juices of the earth. I invigorate and enrich myself
with the waters and herbs of the earth. So I invigorate
and enrich myself with food and energy.
