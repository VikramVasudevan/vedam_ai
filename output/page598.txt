their love.

या at dat: wat रुचो गोष्वश्वेषु या wet: ।
इन्द्राग्नी ताभि: सर्वीभी eet नो धत्त बृहस्पते ison

Ya vo devah surye ruco gosvasvesu ya rucah.
Indragni tabhih sarvabhi rucam no dhatta
brhaspate.

Brihaspati, lord of the great wonderful world,
brilliant powers of divinity, saints and sages, that light
and love of yours which shines in the sun, and that which
reflects in the sun-beams, the earths, fires, sense organs,
cows and horses, with all that light and love, may Indra,
lord of universal energy, and Agni, power of universal
heat and light, and the saints and scholars of the world
bless us.

48. (Brihaspati Devata, Shunah-shepa Rshi)

wet नो afe ब्राह्मणेषु रुच्श्रार्जसु नस्कृधि |
wa विश्येषु शूद्रेषु afl धेहि wer रुर्चम् ॥४८॥

Rucam no dhehi brahmanesu rucain rdajasu
naskrdhi. Rucam visyesu sudresu mayi dhehi
ruca rucam.

Brihaspati, lord of the universe, eminent teacher
and master of vast knowledge, inspire our Brahma
section of the community—scholars, scientists, teachers
and researchers with brilliance and love. Infuse
brilliance, love and justice into our Kshatrias, defence,
administration and justice section of the community.
