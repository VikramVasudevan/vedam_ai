of yajna, I pass on to you this supreme treasure of
knowledge and joy which Jataveda, Agni, and the
devoted scholar of the Veda brought down hitherward
from the highest heavens, and to which the yajamana
also attains following upon the yajna. Know him, and
know and experience that supreme presence and that
supreme joy which abides in the highest heavens.

Lovers of Divinity, noblest scholars and sages,
sitting together in this heavenly home of yajna, know
and realise this supreme creative presence which
pervades the highest and the ultimate spaces of the
universe. Realise its form and power, and feel the bliss
that emanates from this presence. Perform the acts and
observe the devotions prescribed by the Vedas and the
Vedic Traditions for the attainment of this presence
which comes to those who travel by the paths followed
by the godly men and women of divinity.
