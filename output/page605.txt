572 YAJURVEDA

Agni, fire and power of light and life, man of fire
and knowledge, awake, arise, and let the yajamana arise
and act. And both of you together enact the holy rites
and offer the devotions to the Lord. Men and women of
divinity and the yajamana, all be seated in this blessed
house of yajna on the holy seats around the vedi.

62. (Vishvakarma/Agni Devata, Devashrava, Devavata
Rshis)

येन वर्हंसि सहस्त्रं Saba सर्ववेदसम् ।
तेनेमं यज्ञं At नय स्वर्देवेषु weds ॥६२॥

Yena vahasi sahasram yenagne sarvavedasam.
Tenemam yajnam no naya svardevesu gantave.

Lord of fire and knowledge, by the power you
conduct the yajna of a hundred gifts, and the yajna of
total Vedic knowledge, and all the worldly wealth, by
the same power lead on this yajna of ours to reach the
regions of bliss among the noblest souls of divinity.

63. (Yajna Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)
wero परिधिनां eer dent च afeat ।
wan यज्ञं a नय स्व्रर्देवेषु गन्तंवे ॥६३॥

Prastarena paridhina sruca vedya ca barhisa.

vedi’s girdle of fire-sticks, the ladle, the vedi, the kusha
grass and the light of fire, and by the chant of Vedic
hymns, take our yajna on and forward to lead us to reach
the joy of life and the bliss of divinity among the blessed
souls.
