574 YAJURVEDA

I am fire, so by birth, present in all that is born.
Ghee is my light of the eye. Nectar is my mouth. What
I consume turns into nectar. Loved and adored with
Riks, Yajus and Samans, I am threefold in constitution,
my elements being akasha (ether), vayu (wind and
energy), and agni, fire that I am. I pervade and cover
the sky, I am perpetually active and moving. I am the
heat and light of the sun and summer. I am havi, the
food of yajna, and Iam a name, I have an identity of my
own.

67. (Agni Devata, Devashrava & Devavata Rshis)

ऋचो नार्मास्मि astesfe नामास्मि सामांनि नार्मास्मि ।
येऽअग्नय: पार्जञ्चजन्याऽअस्यां पृथिव्यामर्धि ॥ तेर्षामसि
त्वर्मुत्तम: प्र at जीवार्तवे qa ॥६७॥

Reo namasmi yajunsi namasmi samani namasmi.
Ye’ agnayah pancajanya’ asyam prthivyamadhi.
Tesamasi tvamuttamah pra no jivatave suva.

I am Riks by name (Rigveda), I am Yajus, that’s
my name (Yajurveda), I am Samans, that’s my name
(Samveda) for sure.

Yajnagni, five are the sacred fires that are on this
earth (namely, Anvaharya-pachana or Dakshina,
Garhapatya, Ahavaniya, Sabhya, and Avasthya), which
are good and auspicious for all the people without
discrimination. Of them, you are the supreme. Awake,
arise, come and inspire us for a full life on earth,
dedicated to yajna.

68. (Agni Devata, Indra Rshi)

वारत्रहत्याय शार्वसे Terenas च ।
इन्द्र त्वार्वर्तयामसि ॥६८॥
