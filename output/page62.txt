CHAPTER-IT 29

Yajna is dedicated to the study of eight Vasus,
supports of life, eleven Rudras, catalytic agents of the
justice of existence, and twelve Adityas, centres of
gravity and balance of nature. May we, with science
and reason, know with reference to the sun and the earth
what we can achieve with the yajna extended in space.
May Mitra and Varuna, currents of vital energy, protect
and enrich the world with rain. May the oblations in
yajna rise to the sky with the wind, and from the sky to
the sun with the cosmic currents, and bring down from
there showers of rain to feed the rivers of earth. Just as
birds go to rest in their nests, so do we, devotees of the
Lord, meditate on the secrets of vaidic hymns to discover
the mysteries of yajna. Agni, Lord of light and life, you
are the giver of vision. Protect my eye and bless me
with vision.

Agni, Lord of light and life, you hold and sustain
the law of Dharma observed by the powers of nature
and celebrated in the songs of the seers. I accept and
act within the bounds of that law and feed upon the
foods provided by nature and yajna. May I never neglect
or violate that law. May I never be ungrateful to the
Lord. May I never lose the vision of Divinity.
