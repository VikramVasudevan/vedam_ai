CHAPTER-XIX 587

17. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

aan वेदि: water बर्हिषां बर्हिरिंन्द्रियम् ।
यूपेन यूर्पऽआप्यते प्रणीतोऽअग्निरग्निरनां ॥१७॥

Vedya vedih samapyate barhisa barhirindriyam.
Yupena yupa’ apyate pranito’ agniragnina.

By vedi and performance of yajna, yajnic land is
acquired and sanctified. By yajna seats of grass and
noble work, wealth and prosperity is obtained. By the
pillar of yajnic celebration and social cooperation,
honour and celebrity is achieved. And by the yajna fire
and creative work, advancement and honourable
leadership is attained.

18. (Grihapati Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)
gaat यदश्विनाग्नींध्रं यत्सरस्वती |
इन्द्रायैन्द्रश्सरदस्कृतं deiteret गार्ह-पत्य:।।१८॥

Havirdhanam yadasvina” gnidhram yat
sarasvatt. Indradyaindram sadaskrtam
patnisalam garhapatyah.

The Ashvinis, husband and wife, prepare the
yajna chamber and collect the holy materials. Sarasvati
the learned house-wife, is the lady of yajna and the host
for the priests and the guests. The house is the seat of
yajnic prosperity for the master of the house. And the
home is the lady’s forte. This is the house-hold, a socio-
economic yajna in operation.

19. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)
प्रैषेर्भि: प्रैषानाप्नोत्याप्रीर्भिराप्रीर्यज्ञस्य |
प्रयाजेर्भिरनुयाजान् वंषट्कारेभिरार्हुती:।१९॥
