27. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)
वायव्यैर्वायव्सान्याप्नोति सत्तेंन द्रोणकलशम् |
Seago सुते स्थालीर्भि: स्थात्नीराप्नोति ॥२७॥

Vayavyairvayavyanyapnoti satena drona-
kalasam. Kumbhibhyamambhrnau  sute
sthalibhih sthalirapnoti.

With the properties of wind and air you get the
energy of wind and air in the soma in the vayavya air-
vessels. With filtration you get to the drona-measure
vessel of soma. With two jars of corn and water, you
get two water-jar measures of soma, one for stirring
and cleansing and the other for the pure and distilled
soma. And then by cooking cauldrons you get the
finished cauldronfuls of soma offerings for the yajna.

28. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

यर्जुर्भिराप्यन्ते ग्रहा ue: स्तोमांश्च विष्टुती:।
छन्दोभिरुक्थाशस्त्राणि साम्नांवभृथऽरआप्यते URS

Yajurbhirapyante graha grahaih stomdasca
vistutth. ChandobhirukthaSastrani samnava-
bhrtha’apyate.

With verses of Yajurveda, you take ladlefuls of
soma, learn the ways of the world and knowledge of
the stars and planets. With the knowledge and libations,
you come to stomas, hymns of praise and qualities of
things and facts of life. With metres of verses and from
singers, you come to formula hymns of the Veda and
the secrets of weapons. And then with the recitation of

Samans, you come to the valediction of yajna and the
holy bath.
