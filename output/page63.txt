30 YAJURVEDA

18. (Vishvedeva Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)
इमां वाचमभि fast गृणन्तंऽआसद्यास्मिन् बर्हिषिं
मादयध्वश्डैस्वाहा ATE ॥१८॥
Samsravabhaga sthesa brhantah prastaresthah
paridheyasca devah. Imam vacamabhi visve
grnanta’asadyasmin barhisi madayadhvam
svaha vat.

Stay firm, dedicated children of the earth, on the
rock-bed foundations of knowledge and justice, and,
great and expansive within the bounds of Divine law,
sit around this yajna fire on seats of grass, chanting the
holy songs of praise, offering the honey-sweets of your
produce to the fire and receiving from agni, in return,
the nectar of life. Thus you celebrate the Lord’s gift of
life. Thus you enjoy in unison. Surrender and play your
part, this is the voice of Divinity.

19. (Agni-Vayu Devate, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

नर्मश्च assd च amet Bra सन्तिष्ठस्व Fae मे
सन्तिष्ठस्व ॥१९॥

Ghrtaci stho dhuryau patam sumne sthah sumne
ma dhattam. Yajna namasca ta’upa ca yajnasya
Sive santisthasva sviste me santisthasva.

Fire and wind are foremost movers of the wheels
of yajna. Replete in nutriments such as ghee and water,
they are nature’s agents of the growth and sustenance
of humanity in comfort and joy. Yajna and humility are
auspicious for you. Be firm in your devotion and
performance and you will live happy in the protective
shade of the Divine.
