Of the widest range of intelligence and education
among women, a most virtuous and brilliant personality
may come and oblige us as teacher so that these many
girls may be trained in wide knowledge and rational
living for home life and we, as householders, happy
and rejoicing in the corporate life of the community,
may become masters of wealth and honour.
