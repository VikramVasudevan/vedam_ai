Parents, seniors and guardians of humanity in
yajnic seats of power, here are these refreshing
presentations we have prepared for you which you
please accept graciously and enjoy. Come to us and
bring us peace and protection. Bless us with comfort

A’ham pitfntsuvidatran’avitsi napdtam ca

sutasya bhajanta pitvasta’ thagamisthah.

I know the parents, seniors and guardians of life
so kind and generous. I also know the dynamics of Lord
Vishnu’s immanence in His creation.

May the venerable seniors in yajnic seats of
knowledge and vision, who in their own right enjoy the
fragrant drinks distilled from the essence of life, come
here and bless this place and me.
