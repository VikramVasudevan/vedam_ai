CHAPTER-XIX 607

Agnisvattanrtumato havamahe narasaimse
somapitham ya’asuh. Te no viprasah suhava
bhavantu vayam syama patayo rayinam.

Those experts of the science and technology of
fire who work according to the seasons needs and who
enjoy a drink of soma, we invite to social receptions
and honour of felicitations. May they, noble scholars
and creators, be great benefactors of society, and may
we all become producers, protectors and masters of
wealth and prosperity in the world.

62. (Pitarah Devata, Shamkha Rshi)

आच्या wrt दक्षिणतो निषद्येमं यज्ञमभिर्गृणीत fave ।
मा हिंश्सिष्ट पितर: केर्नचिन्नो यद्वऽआर्ग: पुरुषता
HUA ॥६२॥

Acya janu daksinato nisadyemam yajnamabhi
grnita visve. Ma himsista pitarah kenacinno
yadva’ agah purusata karama.

Noble seniors of the world, do not, for any reason
whatever, destroy or injure our manliness and
manpower. Take on this yajna for us, do it well and
speak well of it.

We sit kneeling on your right respectfully, and
whatever your omission or commission in well-meaning
work, we overlook and make up. And then we move on
with the work in earnestness.

63. (Pitarah Devata, Shamkha Rshi)

आसींनासोऽअरुणीनामुपस्थे रयिं र्धत्त दाशुषे मर्त्यय।
Ua: पितरस्तस्य वस्व: Were तऽइहोर्ज` दधात ॥६३॥
