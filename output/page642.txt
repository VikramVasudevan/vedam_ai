waresfe ॥६६॥

Tvamagna’ iditah kavyavahanavaddhavyani
surabhini krtvi. Pradah pitrbhyah svadhaya te’
aksannaddhi tvam deva prayata havinsi.

Agni, brilliant master of noble thoughts, words
and deeds, loved, invoked and adored, receive the gifts
of life, convert them to fragrance and acknowledge.
Share them with the parents, seniors and respectable
people so that they too enjoy them as their own. These
gifts are valuable, prepared and collected with effort.
Generous as you are, enjoy them well.

Ye ceha pitaro ye ca neha yansca vidma yan’u
ca na pravidma. Tvam vettha yati te jatavedah
svadhabhiryajnam sukrtam jusasva.

Agni, brilliant and generous power, the seniors
who are here, and those who are not here, and those
whom we know, and those whom we don’t know, you
know them all, how many they are and where they are,
since you know everything that is anywhere. Let this
yajna of service and adoration be done well. Carry it on
with grace and with gifts made in faith and love.
