of life.

The man of genius and discrimination trained by
a divine sage, like the swan, separates the milk from
the water, accepts the milk and rejects the water.

With his dedication to the essential reality of
existence through yoga, he attains the eternal verity,
divine speech, the vision of word and meaning, purity
of the inner light, spiritual food, honour and prosperity
of the world, purest drinks, abiding health, and the
honey-sweet joys of living.
