CHAPTER-XIX 613

The man of discrimination, friend of pure
visionaries, with the freedom of his vision, distils the
essence, soma, from the waters as the swan separates
the milk from water. He accepts the essence and rejects
the scum.

With his vision of the Vedas, he attains the truth
of divinity, the purity and energy of food, direct
experience of the divine presence, and the supreme taste
of the sweetness and bliss of Immortality and Moksha.

Prajapati, ruler and protector of the people,
President of the council, alongwith the study of the
Vedas, receives the juices, essences and inspiring vital
sweets extracted from the ripe grains and blessed waters
of the land, and wields the onerous responsibility of the
state.

With fair and enlightened justice he attains the
people’s dedication to truth, the divine gift of national
glory, comprehensive protection and defence, pure and
vital foods, light of justice and knowledge, divine grace,
energising drinks, honey, and noble state-order of
immortal value.
