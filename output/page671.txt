638 YAJURVEDA

Let the filament of the soma plant stay joined to
the branch, let the branch with the plant mature and be
whole with the plant.

May the knot of the cane grow out of the knot,
stay joined to the knot, mature and be one and whole
with the tree.

Soma, Spirit of life, may your fragrance and
eternal vitality protect the unity and wholeness of life
among all its constituent parts.

28. (Indra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

सुरांयै ava ud किन्त्वो dafa किन्त्व: ॥२८॥।

Sincanti pari sincantyutsincanti punanti ca.
Surayai babhrvai made kintvo vadati kintvah.

Those who take the shower of bliss in soma, life
divine, merge wholly, purge and raise themselves, and
purify their soul with the nectar for the sake of vitality,
dignity and ecstasy of living, they are the immortals.
‘So what?’ says the sceptic and ends up in the doubt.

29. (Indra Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

इन्द्रं प्रातर्जुषस्व A: ॥२९॥

Dhanavantam karambhinamapupavanta-

Indra, master of knowledge and power of speech,
in the morning accept and enjoy our food, delicious and
rich with nutriments, mixed with curds and honey cakes,
excellently prepared with holy recipes and offered with
reverence.
