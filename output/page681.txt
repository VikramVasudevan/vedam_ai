promoter of His creation. I invoke Him for protection
in every problem of life.

I call upon Indra, royal and brave ruler of the
nation, saviour and protector of the people, and
destroyer of the nation’s enemies. I call upon him for
protection and solution of every problem in the life of
the nation.

I call upon Indra, commander of the army,
defender and protector of the land, instant in action, for
defence in every battle of the nation.

May Indra, saviour, protector, defender and
promoter of life, destroyer of evil and router of the
enemy, lord of power and prosperity, bless us with all
that is good and hold it safe for us.
