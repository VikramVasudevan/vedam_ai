52. (Indra Devata, Garga Rshi)

wet वयश dadt यज्ञियस्यार्पि ae सौमनसे स्याम ।
स सुत्रामा स्ववाँ२॥ऽइन्द्रोऽअस्मेऽआराच्चिद् Ea: सनुत-
Pag ॥५२॥

Tasya’vayam sumatau yajniyasyapi bhadre
saumanase syama. Sa sutrama svavan’indro’
asme’araccid dvesah sanutaryuyotu.

May Indra, lord of life and the world/Ruler of
the land, master of his own power and people, saviour
and protector, always and everyway keep off from us
whatever hate or emity is there far and near.

May we be with him in his yajna of life, in his
creative and constructive works, and abide by him
enjoying the favour of his love as well as judgement.

53. (Indra Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

आ wets हरिंभिर्याहि मयूररोमभि: 1 मा त्वा के
fafa daafa न पाशिनोऽति धन्वेंव ताँ२।।ऽईहि 14301

A mandrairindra haribhiryahi mayiuraromabhih.
Ma tva ke cinni yaman vim na pasino’ti dhanveva
tan thi.

Come Indra, lord of might and majesty, by your
charming peacock-haired horses. Let none whatsoever
hold you back, let no hunter catch you with snares like
a bird. March on like an exceptional hero of the bow,
advance and take them (the enemies) on.
