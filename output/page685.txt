praised all round, should hold in the home the best of
health-giving, rejuvenating and powerful foods for her

59. (Ashvi-Sarasvati-Indra Devata, Vidarbhi Rshi)

सरस्वती तमार्भरद् बर्हिषेन्द्राय ada inven

Asvina namuceh sutam somaim Sukram parisruta.
Sarasvati tamabharad barhisendraya pdtave.

The scholars of science and medicine and women
of knowledge and motherly love, with all their research
and yajnic dedication, should create and bear for Indra
pure nectars of vitality distilled from the juices extracted
from all herbs for the cure of chronic and deadly
diseases.

60. (Ashvi-Sarasvati-Indra Devata, Vidarbhi Rshi)

कवष्यो न व्यर्चस्वतीरश्विभ्यां न दुरो fest:
इन्द्रो न रोदसीऽडभे ge कामान्त्सरस्वती igo

Kavasyo na vyacasvatirasvibhyam na duro
disah. Indro na rodasi’ubhe duhe kamant-
sarasvati.

As the humming bees go round wide spaces, as
wide spaces are lit up by the sun and moon, as Indra,
universal energy, invigorates the heaven and earth, so
does Sarasvati, mother of vision and knowledge, with
the Ashvinis, fiery energy of the sun and soothing beauty
of the moon, create all the means of joy and comfort for
all.
