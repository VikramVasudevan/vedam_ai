80. (Ashvi-Sarasvati-Indra Devata, Vidarbhi Rshi)
अश्विना asta wet: प्राणेन सरस्वती ater ।
वाचेन्द्रो बलेनेन्द्राय दधुरिन्द्रियम् con

ASvina tejasa caksuh pranena sarasvati viryam.
Vacendro balenendraya dadhurindriyam.

Ashivinis, creative powers of nature and the
experts of health and nutrition, Sarasvati, divine
intelligence and the enlightened mother, and Indra, the
sun and the man of knowledge and power, these create
and strengthen for the living soul the eye with light,
virility with pranic energy, a sharp mind with senses,
and honourable disposition with vital energy and noble
speech.

गोर्मदु षु णांसत्याश्वावद्यातमश्विना |

adit रुंद्रा TAT ॥८१॥

Gomadu su nasatyasvavadyatamasvina. Vartti
rudra nrpadyyam.

Ashvinis, eminent teacher and sagely preacher
going by the path of truth, and Rudras, men of justice
and rectitude, go slow by the path of the cow, go fast by
the path of the horse, as is fair, but see you go by the
path which is beneficial to humanity and worthy of
acceptance and support.

दु:शश्सो Act Ra: ॥८२॥

Na yatparo nantara’ adadharsad vrsanvasi.
DuhsSamso martyo ripuh.
