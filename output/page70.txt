CHAPTER-IT 37

Ye rupani pratimuncamana’asurah santah
svadhaya caranti. Parapuro nipuro ye
bharantyagnistamllokat pranuddatyasmat.

And who are the asuras? They are masters of
hypocrisy and the art of changing faces. Friends and
allies of the wicked, they encroach upon the rights of
others and fill their coffers with ill-gotten wealth.
Enemies of humanity, they roam around the world like
giants. Agni, Lord of light, justice and social yajna, let
them be thrown out and eliminated from the face of the
earth.

31. (Pitaras Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)

at पितरो मादयध्वं यथाभागमार्वृषायध्वम्।
अमींमदन्त faett चयथाभागमार्व्रषायिषत ॥३१॥

Atra pitaro madayadhvam yathabhagama-
vrsayadhvam. Amimadanta pitaro yathabhaga-
mavrsayisata.

Trustees and guardians of society, men of
knowledge and wisdom, justice and merit, take your
share as you deserve and, in your own right and proper
place here, rejoice and celebrate the victory of yajna.
Make all others happy and, as they deserve on merit, let
them too rejoice and celebrate.

32. (Pitaras Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)
`पितरो sitara vat a: frat: स्वधायै aut a: पितरो
ana aut a: पितरो waa saat a: पितर: पिर्तरो ant
ard: ॥३२॥
