CHAPTER-XXI 683

38. (Ashvinis and Others Devata, Svastyatreya Rshi)

न सरस्वतीमोजो न जूतिरिन्द्रियं gent न teret भिषग्यश:
मधु व्यन्त्वार्ज्यस्य होतर्यर्जं ॥३८॥

Hota yaksat suretasamrsabham naryapasam
tvastaramindramasvina bhisajam na sarasvati-
mojo na jutirindriyam vrko na rabhaso bhisag
yasah suraya bhesajam Sriya na masaram payah
somah parisruta ghrtam madhu vyantvajyasya
hotaryaja.

Let the man of yajna perform the yajna and invoke
the virile, powerful, noble maker and creator Tvashta,
destroyer of suffering, Indra, lord of power and majesty,
Ashvinis, nature’s energy of wind and electricity,
Sarasvati, universal intelligence as well as the physician,
all creators and harbingers of health and growth. And
like an expert of health he would attain brilliance of health
as well as the drive and splendour for living, ardour of
movement as well as the lightning of the thunderbolt,
honour and reputation as tonics, medicaments with
curative waters, and holy food with beauty and grace.
And further, delicious drinks and milk, soma distilled as
the essence of herbal juices, butter and nectars of waters,
and honey would follow and flow upon the earth.

Man of yajna, perform the yajna with the best of
ghee.
