698 YAJURVEDA
Deva devanam bhisaja hotaravindramasvina.
Vasatkaraih sarasvati tvisim na hrdaye matim
hotrbhyam dadhurindriyam vasuvane vasu-
dheyasya vyantu yaja.

Noble and brilliant powers of divinity, priests of
the noble and generous people, the Ashvinis, learned
scholars, the physicians, and Sarasvati, the voice of
divinity, with Vashatkara hymns by the priests of yajna,
vest Indra, lustrous man of yajna, with divine light and
lightning energy in the heart as well as intelligence in
the mind. Thus do they bring wealth of the world and
splendour of life to the man of yajna and perfect him in
his desire and ambition.

Man of yajna, keep up the sacrifice for perfection
in life.

Devistisrastisro devirasvineda sarasvati. Sisamn

Three brilliant and divine powers, Ida, divine
speech, Sarasvati, divine universal intelligence, and
Bharati, specific energies of nature in various forms,
and these three, further, alongwith the Ashvinis,
complementary currents of universal energy, hold
strength and splendour for the soul and infuse it into
the middle of the body-system by the navel for the soul’s
perfection.
