702 YAJURVEDA

physician, the generous and all-loved tree, the dear
powers of nature which feed on the food of yajna, and
all-loved vital heat—all these work with the universal
fire for the creation of wealth and energy.

Thus any versatile performer of yajna (individual,
social and natural) has the secret of success and creates
honour, glory, energy and fame for the dedicated souls.

May all the powers of yajna create and carry the
wealth of the world for the man of yajna.

Man of yajna, carry on with the sacrifice.

Let the yajamana to-day, cooking the yajna
offerings and preparing the oblations, select Agni as
the high-priest and as the deity. The devotees rear and
bind the goat for milk and butter for the Ashvinis, prana
and apana energy, sheep for Sarasvati, universal
intelligence, and the bull for Indra, honour and lustre,
and they extract and distil the exhilarating soma drink
for the Ashvins, Sarasvati and the protector Indra, the
ruler.
