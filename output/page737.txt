O Rishi, seer blest, child of the Rishis and the
tradition of the Rishis: of the many noble sages
assembled here to-day, this yajamana opts for you,
saying: “This sage among the generous and brilliant ones
would gain for us the consecrated shower of wealth and
vision.”

Noble sage, give unto us of those gifts which the
divinities have granted, pray for us, raise us and keep
up the tradition.

Hota, man of yajna, you are the man inspired and
sent to pronounce the sacred Word and sing the hymns
of divinity. Pray, speak the Word, sing the hymns of
praise.
