aifuenssifa भुर्वनमसि aansft erat ।
स त्वमग्निं ayaa ae गच्छ स्वारहाक्कृत:।३॥

Abhidha’asi bhuvanamasi yanta’si dharta. Sa
tvamagnim vaisvanaram saprathasam gaccha
svahakrtah.

You are the preceptor and teacher. You are the
realized soul. You are the guide. You are the support
and preserver of the knowledge and the law. Yajamana,
initiated and consecrated by the sacred acts of yajna,
take up, research and realize Agni, omnipresent vitality
of the world, expansive and infinite.

4. (Vishvedeva Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

प्रजार्पतये at राध्यासम् i तं र्लधान ease: प्रजार्पतये
wt राध्नुहि ॥४॥

Svaga tva devebhyah prajapataye brahmann-
asvam bhantsyami devebhyah prajapataye tena
radhyasam. Tam badhana devebhyah
prajapataye tena radhnuhi.

Man of knowledge, scholar of divinity and the
Veda, I consecrate you as free independent researcher
in the service of the noblest powers of the world and the
ruler-guardian of the people.

I shall control powerful energy like a horse for the
noblest powers and the ruler-guardian of the people. I
shall thereby realise the mission of my life.

Bind and control energy for the divinities and the

ruler-guardian and thereby realise the mission of your
life.
