710 YAJURVEDA

All hail and reverence for the man of endeavour,
running, advancing, flying high, acting promptly, and for
the man who has achieved instant success and
accomplishment. Reverence to the man who is of stable
mind, of high values, speed and strength. Reverence to
the man who is expansive, and has achieved
advancement and peace. Reverence for the agitative and
sympathy for the shaken. Welcome and reverence for
the man who wants to listen and is listening, for the
man who is watching, who is watched, and who is
watched and guarded for security reasons. Reverence
for the yogi with closed eyes. Reverence for any one
who eats and drinks and who removes the waste of the
system. Reverence to the man who is doing the job and
to the one who has done and calls it a day.

(Those who honour the men of action and
accomplishment find recognition peace and happiness.)

our mind and soul.
