The power of Agni is light and energy/electricity
which creates and produces the circuitous currents-
going up as prana in the universe as well as in the body,
and the complementary current going down as apana in
the body as well as in the universe. This universal energy
of Agni is a mighty power which is the light of heaven
and burns in the sun.
