CHAPTER-XXII 717

(Republic) of ours, let the Brahmanas rise as a
community of brilliant men of divinity and illustrious
scholars of universal knowledge. Let the Kshatriyas rise
as a force of heroic warriors of the chariot and routers
of the enemy with unfailing arrows. May the cows be
fertile and abundant in milk, the oxen, carriers of heavy
load, the coursers, swift, the women, kind and generous;
and may the children (people) of this yajamana, the ruler,
be brave and fearless, victorious riders of the chariot,
and youthful and civilized members of the council.

May the clouds rain in showers for us according
to the need of the seasons. May the herbs and trees
mature and ripen with abundant fruit. And may this land
be securely blest with a ceaseless cycle of growth and
protection of happiness and prosperity.
