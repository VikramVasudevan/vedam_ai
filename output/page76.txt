CHAPTER-ITI 43

Agnirjyotirjyotiragnih svaha -suryo jyotirjyotih
suryah svaha. Agnirvarco jyotirvarcah svaha
suryo varco jyotirvarcah svaha. Jyotih suryah
suryo jyotih svaha.

Agni, Supreme Spirit, is the light (jyoti) of
existence, and Light (jyoti), Eternal Consciousness, is
the identity of the Spirit. Vak, the virtual speech of
Eternity is the common attribute of both spirit and
consciousness.

Sun, the Lord of Life, is the light (jyoti) of the
world, and Light (jyoti), Omniscience, is the identity of
the Sun, the Divine teacher of teachers. Veda, the
universal voice of Divinity is the common attribute of
both the knower (sun) and knowledge (Omniscience).

Fire is the power and prosperity of the world, and
power and prosperity from the heat energy of fire is
converted to power by science and technology.
Tecknowledge with its language is for the common
benefit of both, the fire and the user.

The sun is the power and prosperity of the world,
and power and prosperity flows from the vital energy of
the sun converted to power by science and technology.
Tecknowledge with its language is for the common
benefit of both, solar energy and the user.

Light is the Lord and the Lord is Light. Light
and the Lord are one. Veda, knowledge, is coexistent
with both in unison. We offer the oblations to the Lord
for the Light in faith with reverence.
