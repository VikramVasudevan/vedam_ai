CHAPTER-XXIII 727

Lord of this great universe, through the discipline
of yoga you are realized and consecrated in the heart
and soul, and loved in faith for the sake of Prajapati,
protector and guardian of the people. I accept and
surrender to you.

This Prakriti and the world of forms is your seat
of immanence. The sun is the manifestation of your
grandeur. The glory of yours which manifests in the
day and in the year, the glory which manifests in the air
and in the sky, the glory which manifests in the sun and
in heaven, to that glory and to you we offer our homage
and worship for the sake of Prajapati, guardian of the
people, and the devas, noble and generous powers of
nature and humanity.

3. (Parameshvara Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

a: प्रांणतो र्निमिषतो र्महित्वैकऽ इद्राजा जर्गतो aya |

Yah pranato nimisato mahitvaika ’idraja jagato
babhuva. Ya ise’asya dvipadascatuspadah
kasmai devaya havisa vidhema.

The sole one lord who, with His own might, creates
and rules over the world of those who breathe and see,
the lord who rules over men and animals, to that sovereign
lord of bliss and majesty we offer our homage and
worship with our heart and soul.
