CHAPTER-XXIII 729

Those who join their mind and soul to the great
and glorious presence of God vibrating like electric
energy in the moving and non-moving forms of
existence, shine like the sunlight in heaven.

6. (Surya Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

युञ्जन्त्यस्य काम्या हरी विर्पक्षसा cat ।
शोणां धृष्णू TAA ॥६॥

Yurijantyasya kamya hari vipaksasda rathe. Sona
dhrsnu nrvahasa.

Just as they yoke to the chariot two strong,
handsome, reddish horses worthy of ride by men and
loved by all, so do the yogis join their senses, mind and
soul to Ishvara, lord and light of the world.

(So do the scientists use the carrier currents of
solar and electric energy, 1.e., the energy of Surya/sun
and Indra/electricity, in the service of humanity for the
divine purpose.)

7. (Indra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

agrissiarssrhirr प्रियामिन्द्रस्य तन्त्रम् ।
Ue पथा पुनरश्वमार्वर्त्तयासि A: ॥७॥

Yadvato ’apo’aganigan priyamindrasya tanvam.
Etai stotaranena patha punarasSvamavartayasi
nah.

O man of the science-mantra, the celestial horse,
mighty carrier, flies across the waters of the sky and the
wondrous oceans of space on the wings of the winds.
The same horse, by the same paths of energy, you bring
us back and take us round.
