736 YAJURVEDA

protective fatherly presence over all the groups,
communities and republics of the world. Such as you
are, we accept, realise and surrender unto you.

You are the darling life-giver and protector of all
things of existence which are so dear to you. We
recognise, realise and worship you in love and faith.

You are the giver, protector and promoter of all the
wealths of the world. We surrender to you in worship
and gratitude and pray to you for all the wealth, prosperity
and happiness of life.

Lord omnipresent in every particle of existence,
every particle of existence exists in you. You are my
haven and home too. You are the father of all forms of
existence. I pray that I may know you, the father, that I
may know Prakriti, the mother; and that I may know all
the forms of existence, as you do.

20. (Raja & Praja Devate, Prajapati Rshi)

Let both of them, the ruler and the people, protect
and support each other. May both realise and extend
the four values of life: Dharma, righteous living, Artha,
worldly well-being, kama, self-fulfilment, and Moksha,
ultimate freedom. May the ruler, wielder of power, swift
in action and advancement, strengthen the people with
power, and the people, in return, strengthen the ruler
with power.
