738 YAJURVEDA

no false promises to us. Let your mouth be not like a
boaster’s. If you tell lies, you will grow weaker and
weaker like a helpless bird and end up, cheating yourself.

24. (Bhumi and Surya Devate, Prajapati Rshi)
माता च a frat a ast qeret trea: |
प्रतिंलामीतिं ते frat गभे मुष्टिर्मतश्सयत् ॥२४॥

Mata ca te pita ca te’ gram vrksasya rohatah.
Pratilamiti te pita gabhe mustimatamsayat.

Ruler, the earth your mother and the sun your father
rise to the top of the world. The sun strikes at the treasure
of space-waters with his light and power, the earth
receives the showers and shines. Celebrate them with
the people in yajna: It is beautiful, it is joyous. I am happy.

25. (Bhumi and Surya Devate, Prajapati Rshi)
माता च ते पिता च ase qeret क्रीडत: |
विर्वक्षतऽड्व a Wa ब्रह्मन्मा त्वं dat ae Rea

Mata ca te pita ca te’gre vrksasya kridatah.
Vivaksata’iva te mukham brahman ma tvam
vado bahu.

People of the land, your mother-land like the earth
and the ruler, father of the nation, like the sun, both
joyous, play on top of the world in the midst of beauty
and prosperity. Ruler, Brahma, presiding priest of the
national yajna, your mouth seems eager to shout with
pride and joy. At that time, speak not much, control
yourself.

26. (Shri Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

अर्थास्यै मर्ध्यमेधताश्छंशीते ard पुनन्निव ॥२६॥
