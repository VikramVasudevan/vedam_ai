29. (Scholars Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

agarat ललार्मगुं प्र विंष्टीमिनमार्विषु: ।
सक्थ्ना dfavaa ant सत्यस्याक्षिभुरवो यथा ॥२९॥

Yaddevaso lalamagum pravistiminamavisuh.

30. (Raja Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

यर्द्धरिणो यवमत्ति न पुष्टं पशु मर्न्यते ।
Vet यदर्यजारा न Urata धनायति ॥३०॥

Yaddharino yavamatti na pustam pasu manyate.
Sudra yadaryajara na posaya dhanayati.

When the deer eats up the barley it does not care
for the field but destroys it. A servant woman who is
the mistress of her master loves money but not for the

ruler exploits his people, he does not care for their well-
being, he destroys the nation.

31. (Raja Praja Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

यर्द्धरिणो यवमत्ति न पुष्टं बहु मर्न्यते ।
Vet aes जारो न areata ॥३१॥

Yaddharino yavamatti na pustam bahu manyate.
Sudro yadaryayai jaro na posamanumanyate.

The deer that eats up the barley cares not for the
