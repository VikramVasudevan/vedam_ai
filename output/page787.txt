and drink the nectar of life and immortality by divine

THOTT ॥६७॥
Prajapate na tvadetanyanyo visva rupani pari
ta babhuva. Yatkamaste juhumastanno’astu
vayam syama patayo rayinam.

Whatever our ends and aims for which we offer
our homage to you, may all that come true for us.

May we, by Grace, be masters, promoters and
preservers of the wealths of the world.
