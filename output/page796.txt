CHAPTER-XXIV 763

Agnaye ’nikavate prathamajanalabhate marud-
bhyah santapanebhyah savatyan marudbhyo
grhamedhibhyo baskihan marudbhyah kridi-
bhyah sainsrstan marudbhyah svatavadbhyo’
nusrstan.

The man of wisdom and discrimination favours
and selects first-born heroes for admirable Agni, fiery
commander of the army, acclimatised animals for the
disciplined heroes of the speed of the winds, well reared
animals for the homely yajnic people, well-trained
animals for the sportive fun-loving people, and
domesticated animals for the quiet settled people.

Uktah sancara’eta’aindragnah prasrnga
mahendra bahurupa vaisvakarmanah.

Described are these animals and the ways of raising
and training them. Of divine care and purpose, they are
of varied hue and beautiful horns, favourites of divinities
and for divine purpose. Of Indra and Agni they are, of
Mahendra and Vishvakarma.
