Agni, wonderful lord and treasure-home of the
wealth of the world, we, men of full life and vigour,
strong yet forbearing, fearless and irresistible, having
lighted the fire of yajna in worship of you — you, bright
and blazing, giver of life and health, strength and
forbearance, irresistible destroyer of enemies —we pray
that we keep the fire of yajna burning and bright in
honour and service of you. May we, by your grace and
blessing, overcome the want and hurdles of life and
attain prosperity and happiness. May we thus live on
for a hundred years and more.
