The shoulders of the nation belong to the Maruts,
that is, the stormy troops of defence are the shoulders
of the nation. The first and top part of the spine belongs
to Vishvedevas, that is, the generous and enlightened
people are the top of the nation’s spine. The second
part of the spine belongs to the Rudras, men of law and
justice. The third part belongs to the Adityas, brilliant
people and children of the earth. The tail end belongs
to Vayu, breath and fragrance of the nation. The hips of
the nation belong to Agni and Soma, the heat of fire
and coolness of water in the national mind. The poets
and artists, two beautiful hansa birds, are comparable
to the loins of the nation. Indra and Brihaspati, ruler
and teachers, are comparable to the thighs. Mitra and
Varuna, friendship and discrimination, are comparable
to the groins. Develop force and advancement by the
strength and suppleness of the thighs. Judge the strength
and vitality of the nation by the slopes of the groin.
