You are in the bosom of Indra, father of light, let
not the light sink into darkness.

Stand firm, the food and fertility of the earth is
where you stand. The meeting of the directions of space
is in the joints of the ribs. The light within is the light of
heaven. Know the shower of the clouds by the joy of
the soul in the blood, the broadness of the skies by the
coronary artery, the soothing liquidity of atmospheric
water by the serum juices of the belly, the energy of
life, like the love of chakravaka birds, by the pulmonary
arteries, the purity of light by the cleansing action of
the excretory organs, the hardness of mountains by
digestion and assimilation, the cloud-generosity by the
spleen, the paths of movement by the blood vessels,
concentrations and enlargements by the veins, streams
and rivers by the blood-streams, gulfs and bays by the
womb and ovaries, the sea by the stomach, and universal
fire by the heat of the body system.

(Note the correspondence of the microcosm (eka-
raat-purusha) and the macrocosm (Viraat-purusha) and
the correspondence of the working of the two systems.
The individual system works within the universal system
as a unit. And this correspondence is worth knowing.
The human individual is in the bosom of the universal
Indra.)
