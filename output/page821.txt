788 YAJURVEDA

May all the scholars of the world come to bless
us with protection and progress to our goal here in this
life itself.

21. (Vidvans Devata, Gotama Rshi)
भद्रं multe: श्वृणुयाम ear ag र्पश्येमाक्षर्भिर्यजत्रा: |
स्थिरैरङ्गैस्तुष्टुवार्सस्तनूभिर्व्यशेमहि gated यदार्यु: ॥२१॥

Bhadram karnebhih srnuyama deva bhadram
pasyemaksabhiryajatrah. Sthirairangai-
stustuvamsastanubhirvyasemahi devahitam
yadayuh.

Devas, men of knowledge and divinity, dedicated
to yajna, may we hear only good with our ears, may we
see only good with our eyes. Singing songs of praise
with strong and stable limbs, may we live our full span
of life, enjoying with strong and healthy bodies in the
service of God and the divines.

22. (Vidvans Devata, Gotama Rshi)
शतमिन्नु शरदोऽअन्तिं Sar sat नश्चक्रा जरसं तनूर्नाम्।
पुत्रासो at पितरो भर्वन्ति मा नो मध्या रीरिषतायुर्गन्तो:॥२२॥

Sataminnu Sarado’anti deva yatra nascakra
jarasam tanunam. Putraso yatra pitaro bhavanti
ma no madhya ririsatayurgantoh.

Scholars of knowledge and wisdom, while we are
close to you, help us to live a full life of hundred years in
good health of body wherein our children too may grow
to be fathers of their children. Let not our life be hurt or
injured. Let it not perish on the way in the middle of the
course.
