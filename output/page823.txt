Yannirnija reknasa pravrtasya ratim grbhitam
mukhato nayanti. Supranajo memyadvisvarupa’
indrapusnoh priyamapyeti pathah.

The persons who gratefully receive the gifts of the
lord giver and with that pure and sacred wealth move the
cycle of charity on ward; and also the self-developing
man of immortal spirit with initiative and versatile
potential in many fields; they all go forward on the
favourite path of Indra and Pusha, blest with power and
progress.

Storer faraa ॥२६॥।

Esa chagah puro’ asvena vajina pusno bhago

dasamarvata tvastedenam sauSravasaya jinvati.
When this aggressive leader, distinguished among
equals of divine quality and loved of Pusha (the
President), is advanced to the front by the dynamic
nation, then Tvashta, maker of men and nations, receives
him as a lovely gift of national yajna and, alongwith
the nation, refines him with sanctification for honour
and glory.
