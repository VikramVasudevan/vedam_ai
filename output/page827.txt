794 YAJURVEDA

Yatte gatradagnina pacyamanddabhi sulam
nihatasyavadhavati. Ma tadbhumyamasrisanma
trnesu devebhyastadusadbhyo rdtamastu.

If your person is on the stake being developed
and matured by fire, and you feel strained, exhausted,
almost dead, then whatever cry of pain escapes your
lips, let it not fall into the dust, nor let it be lost in the
straw, but let it be a valuable subject of study for the
noble scholars who are keen to rectify it.

35. (Vishvedevas Devata, Gotama Rshi)
a ahr ukusdta vad usdre: Heart ।
a चार्वतो aesatanardassal catahnihrts-
इन्वतु ॥३५॥
Ye vajinam paripasyanti pakvam ya’imahuh
surabhirnirhareti. Ye carvato mansabhiksa-
mupasata’ uta tesamabhigurtirna’ invatu.

Those who watch the nation’s food grow to
ripeness, and those who say: It is fragrant, harvest it,
and those who serve their share in the growth of the
nation on the move, may all their effort be for the benefit
of us all.

36. (Yajna Devata, Gotama Rshi)
यन्नीरक्षणं माँस्पर्चन्याऽउखाया या पात्राणि यूष्णऽआसेर्चनानि।
Saar ster चरूणामङ्का: सूना: परिभूषन्त्य्वम् ॥३६॥
Yanniksanam maimspacanya ’ukhaya ya patrani
yusna’asecanani. Usmanya’pidhana caruna-
mankah sunah pari bhusantyasvam.
Watchful stirring (replenishment) of the earth’s

fertility for the growth of grain and fruit, whatever
containers and reservoirs of water there be for growth
