CHAPTER-ITI 51

Come earth, come freedom, justice and
abundance. May all desires come true wholly. May the
Lord in-vest me with the stability of ambition and
fulfilment thereof.

28. (Brihaspati Devata, Prabandhu Rshi)
Maes कृणुहि र्ब्रह्मणस्पते ।
कक्षीर्वन्तं यऽर्जऔशिज: ॥२८॥

Somanam svaranam krnuhi brahmanaspate.
Kaksivantam ya’ auSijah.

Lord of Eternal knowledge, keen as I am for
knowledge and learning like a very child of Wisdom,
shape me into a scholar with a sense of ethical values, a
persuasive speaker and a teacher and maker of
rejuvenating tonics.

29. (Brihaspati Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

यो tart aisahiag वंसुवित्पुंष्टिवर्द्धन: |
स a: सिषक्तु यस्तुर: ॥२९॥

Yo revan yo’amivaha vasuvitpustivarddhanah.
Sa nah sisaktu yasturah.

May He who is Lord of wealth and knowledge,
who destroys pain, grief and disease, who is the knower
of all the good things of the world, who gives all physical
and spiritual strength, who is keen and instant in doing
and having things done, may He bless us with all virtues
and good actions.

30. (Brahmanaspati Devata, Varuni Saptadhriti Rshi)
मा न: शश्सोऽअररुषो धूर्ति: प्रणङ् मर्त्यस्य ।
Tat णो ब्रह्मणस्पते ॥३०॥
