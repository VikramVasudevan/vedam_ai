808 YAJURVEDA

dedication now is your end and aim of life. I accept and
honour you for the sake of the unity of humanity and
conquest of hate and fear.

11. (Agni Devata, Nodha Gotama Rshi)

तं at दस्मर्मृतीषहं वरसोर्मन्दानमरन्धस: |
अभि aa न स्वर्सरेषु धेनवऽइन्द्रं गीर्भिर्न`वामहे ॥११॥

Tam vo dasmamrtisaham vasormandana-
mandhasah. Abhi vatsam na svasaresu dhenava’
indram girbhirnavamahe.

Just as cows in their stalls every day call forth the
calf for the feed and rejoice, so do we, for you all, in
songs of love and joy, invoke and celebrate Indra, the
ruler, dynamic lord of wondrous deeds and felicity who
takes delight in the food and nourishment of his people
and loves to see them settled in good homes in a state
of comfort and prosperity.

12. (Agni Devata, Nodha Gotama Rshi)

महिषीवब त्वद्रयिस्त्वद्वाजाऽउर्दीरते ॥१२॥

Yadvahistham tadagnaye brhadarca vibhavaso.
Mahisiva tvadrayistvadvaja ’udirate.

Vibhavasu, lord of brilliance and power, ruler of
the world, honour and celebrate him who carries the
highest and heaviest burdens of the state in the service
of Agni, self-refulgent glory of the human nation. Like
the queen of magnificence, all the wealth of food, power
and prosperity of the nation issues forth from your palace
and personality. Honour Him (Agni), let us honour Him.
