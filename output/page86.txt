Te hi putraso’ aditeh pra jivase martyaya.
Jyotiryacchantyajasram.

Mitra, pranic energy, Varuna, air and water, and
Aryama, the sun, they are the children of Imperishable
Nature. They provide inexhaustible light and energy for
the life and sustenance of the mortals on earth.

34. (Indra Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)
awa चन स्तरीरंसि Ad सश्चसि दाशुर्षे ।
उपोपेन्नुर्मघवन् भूयऽइन्नु ते दार्न देवरस्य पृच्यते gw

Kada cana staritrasi nendra sascasi dasuse.
Upopennu maghavan bhiuya’ innu te danam
devasya prcyate.

Indra, lord of generosity and well-being, when is
it that you don’t wholly favour the man of charity,
overwhelming him with gifts of knowledge and joy?
Lord giver of power and prosperity, your gifts of reward
for karma (action), again and again, constantly, follow
upon the philanthropists’ acts of charity.

35. (Savita Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

ad संवितुर्वरेण्यं भर्गो gat धीमहि ।
feat यो 4: प्रचोदयांत् ॥३५॥

Tatsaviturvarenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi.
Dhiyo yo nah pracodayadt.

Let us meditate on the blazing glory of Savita, Lord
Creator, pure and generous giver of light and happiness
— glory which is magnificent, most worthy of our choice.
And may the Lord with His grace inspire our mind and
will to dedicate ourselves to noble actions.
