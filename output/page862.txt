CHAPTER-XXVII 829

Tava vayavrtaspate tvasturjamdataradbhuta.
Avamsya vrnimah.

Vayu, sustainer of truth and the laws of nature,
wonderful power, maker of new forms and shaper of the
new generations for Tvashta, lord creator, we pray for
your gifts of protection, sustenance and advancement.

35. (Vayu Devata, Vasishtha Rshi)

अभि wat शूर नोनुमोऽदुंग्धा s ga धेनर्व:।
ईर्शानमस्य जर्गत: स्वर्दृशमीशानमिन्द्र तस्थुर्ष:।।३५॥

Abhi tva Sura nonumo’dugdha’iva dhenavah.
Isanamasya jagatah svardrsamisanamindra
tasthusah.

Indra, fearless and brave, lord and ruler of the
moving and the unmoving world, it is bliss to see you!
Like unmilked cows yearning for their calves, we invoke
you to pay homage to you.

36. (Parameshvara Devata, Shamyubarhaspatya Rshi)
न त्वावा २॥ऽअन्यो दिव्यो न पार्थिवो न जातो न जनिष्यते।
अश्वायन्तो मघवन्निन्द्र वाजिनों terxdear हवामहे ॥३६॥

Na tvavan’anyo divyo na parthivo na jato na
janisyate. ASvayanto maghavannindra vajino
gavyantastva havamahe.

Indra, supreme lord of power and glory, destroyer
of pain and suffering, there is none other like you on
earth or in heaven ever born or yet to be born in future.
Blest with horse and speed, food and power, cows and
wealth of holy Word, still yearning to move faster and
higher, we come and offer homage and worship to you.
