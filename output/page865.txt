invite, honour and celebrate you. Let us all together
celebrate and sing in praise of Agni, immortal and
omniscient lord, as a darling friend of ours.

43. (Agni Devata, Bhargava Rshi)

पाहि नों ऽ अग्न ऽ Uhar पाह्युत द्वितीर्यया ।
पाहि गीर्भिस्तिसृभिरुर्जा wa पाहि र्चतसूर्भिर्वसो ॥४३॥

Pahi no’agna’ekaya pahyuta dvitiyaya. Pahi
girbhistisrbhirurjam pate pahi catasrbhirvaso.
Agni, lord of knowledge, action, love and
freedom, master of life, energy and food, home and
shelter of all forms of existence, protect and promote
us by one voice, voice of the Riks, for knowledge.
Protect and promote us by the second voice, voice of
the Yajus, for action. Protect and promote us by the three
voices of Riks, Yajus and Samans for knowledge, action
and worship. Protect and promote us by the four voices
of Riks, Yajus, Samans and Atharvans, for Dharma,
Artha, Kama and Moksha.

44. (Vayu Devata, Shamyu Rshi)

ऊर्जो नर्पातश्स हिनायर्मस्मयुर्दार्शेम हव्यर्दातये ।
भुवद्वार्जेष्वविता भुर्वद् वृधऽडत त्राता तनूर्नाम् ॥४४॥

Urjo napatain sa hindyamasmayurdadsema
havyadataye. Bhuvadvajesvavita bhuvad vrdha’
uta trata tanunam.

Scholar, sage, teacher, learner, promote the child
of life and energy, vayu, agni and knowledge, which
allow not the grandeur of life to diminish, so that nature
and knowledge may be our friends, protect us in the
battles of life and continue to be the saviours of our
persons and people. Friends as they are, we invoke them
