CHAPTER-XXVIII 843

Devi’ urjahuti dughe sudughe payasendrama-
vardhatam. Isamurjamanya vaksatsagdhim
Ssapitimanya navena purvam dayamdne
puranena navamadhatamurjamurjahutt’
urjayamane vasu varyani yajamanaya Siksite
vasuvane vasudheyasya vitam yaja.

Two sacred divinities of nature, day and night,
holding strength and energy, both generous and
abundant in joy and fulfilment, nourish and advance
Indra, spirit of humanity and prosperity of the world.
One of them, the night, begets food and replenishment
of energy and the other, the day, begets a common meal
and common drink for us. Full of peace and joy, they
hold and join the old with the new, and the new with
the old.

Replete with the spirit and wisdom of divinity,
blest with wealth of energy, blessing all with energy,
they hold the choicest gifts of life in store for the
yajamana, the human soul, and bring us showers of
peace and grace of God upon the earth.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna in unison with
the night and day.
