The lord of sun-beams, the Tree of life, brilliant
with its lustrous virtues, of golden leaves, honeyed
branches and delicious fruit strengthens and elevates
the divine Indra, power of generosity and eliminater of
poverty. With its top it reaches the light of heaven,
energises and expands the skies, and strengthens and
enriches the earth. And thus it brings for the dedicated
world of humanity the riches as blessings of the lord of
the treasures of the universe.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna in unison with
the sun and the Tree, never relent.
