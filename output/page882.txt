delicacies, collecting the herbs and goat’s milk,
cleansing and strengthening, invokes the fire and selects
the priest to-day.

The lord of sun-beams and herbs, the sun, joins

advance your wealth and honour too.

Let the man of piety offer yajna in dedication to
Agni, lighted, blazing, great and glorious, worthy of
choice, and to Indra, lord of power and grandeur, giver
of good health and long life. Let him chant the Gayatri,
treasure of joy and giver of the freedom of thought, and
he would be blest with wealth of mind and senses, riches
of the thrice protective earth mother, good health and
long age.

Man of yajna, extend and expand the yajna and
enjoy the best of knowledge and honour in the world.
