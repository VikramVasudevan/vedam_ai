854 YAJURVEDA

Let the hota offer yajna to Tvashta, generous
creator, lord giver of growth, maker and bearer of fine
forms and their sustenance in the various world, and let
him do honour to Indra, lord of the beauty and wealth
of the world, and, holding on to the wisdom of the two-
part verses of the Veda, freedom, honour and fame and
the joy and generosity of life like a virile bull, increase
and enjoy the beauty of the world.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna.

Let the hota do yajna in honour of Vanaspati, lord
of sunbeams and greenery, inspiring hero of a hundred
actions, golden winged, celebrated in Uktha verses,
holding the reins of time, keeping the world to order,
lord of glory, wielder of power and giver of life. And
holding on to the kakubh verses, freedom of thought,
power of sense and mind, dry cows and cows in season,
and beauty of life, he may increase, promote and enjoy
the wealth and sweetness of life.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna.
