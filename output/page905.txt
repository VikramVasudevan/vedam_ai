prosperity and joy. And they say your bonds are three
in heaven.

(You are Agni, the sun, therefore you have to be
brilliant because you cannot be the sun without the light.
You are at peace in security as one member of the galaxy
family of suns and stars. And you are happy with the
prosperity of your own solar family. You have to observe
this triple bond.)

15. (Agni Devata, Bhargavo Jamadagni Rshi)
त्रीणि तऽआहुर्दिवि ceri त्रीण्यप्सु त्रीण्यन्त: GAS |
उतेवं मे वरुंणश्छन्त्स्यर्वन्यत्रां तऽआहु: Ua जनित्रम् ea

Trini ta’ahurdivi bandhanani trinyapsu
trinyantah samudre. Uteva me varunasch-
antsyarvanyatra ta’ahuh paramam janitram.

Arvan, lord of the dynamics of existence, three
are your bonds in heaven, they say, three in the waters
of space and three in the womb of the sea. Wherever,

presence as Varuna, lord of our choice and lord of
judgement and approval.

अत्रां ते भद्रा रंशनाऽरअंपश्यमृतस्य चयाऽर्भिरर्क्षन्ति
THOT: ॥१६॥
Ima te vajinnavamarjananima saphanam sani-
turnidhana. Atra te bhadra rasSana’apasya-
mrtasya ya’abhiraksanti gopah.

Warlike hero, lord of spirit and speed, I see these
tools of the cleansing and freshening of your war-horses.
