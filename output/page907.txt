CHAPTER-XXIX 873

19. (Manushya Devata, Bhargavo Jamadagni Rshi)

afd त्वा रथोऽअनु मर्योऽअर्वन्ननु गावोऽनु भर्ग: कनीनांम्।
a ante सख्यमींयुररनुं gar र्ममिरे dif ते een

Anu tva ratho’anu maryo’arvannanu gavo’ nu
bhagah kaninam. Anu vratasastava sakhya-
miyuranu deva mamire viryam te.

Arvan, tempestuous victorious hero, the chariot
follows you. The humans and cows follow you. The
power and passion of youth follows you. Multitudes of
people love to be friends and followers with you. Even
the divinities have watched, measured and admired your
courage and valour.

20. (Agni Devata, Bhargavo Jamadagni Rshi)

हिरण्यशुङ्खोऽर्योऽअस्य पादा मनोजवाऽअर्वरऽइन्द्रऽआसीत्।
देवाऽडइदस्य हविररद्यमायन्योऽअर्वन्तं प्रथमोऽअध्य--
Fats ॥२०॥

Hiranyasrngo’yo’asya pada manojava’avara’
indra’ asit. Deva’idasya haviradyamayan yo’
arvantam prathamo ’adhyatisthat.

(Who can ride and control the tempestuous horse
that is agni, fire power of nature and humanity?)

Indra, master ruler, youthful and new. Golden is
his crown. Of golden steel are his legs moving at the
speed of mind. New and youthful, he is supreme. The
noblest of humanity share power with him and partake
of his holy food. First among all, he alone can ride and
control the speed and power of agni.
