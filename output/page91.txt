46. (Indra and Maruts Devate, Agastya Rshi)

मो षू र्णऽइन्दरात्रं पृत्सु देवैरस्ति fe wat ते शुष्मिन्नवया:।
Tears मीढुरषो यव्या efastar मरुतो वन्दंते TH: EN

Mo su na’ indratra prtsu devairasti hi sma te
Susminnavayah. Mahascidyasya midhuso yavya
havismato maruto vandate gth.

Mighty Indra, in the battles of this life, protect
us well along with the learned and the wise, hurt us not.
Lord of infinite power, surely the high and divine voice
of yours reveals the nature and virtue of those who, in
every season, with appropriate samagri, perform the
yajnas. The yajamana, host-performer of yajna, with his
offerings sings the songs of praise in honour of the lord
of rain and the carriers of the yajna, the winds.

47. (Agni Devata, Agastya Rshi)

अक्रन् कर्म` cated: Ge वाचा darsat |
ang: कर्म` par wd सचाभुव: ॥४७॥

Akran karma karmakrtah saha vaca mayobhuva.
Devebhyah karma krtvastam preta sacabhuvah.

Men of noble action, yajna, who act together in
the company of the pious and dedicated people, using
the delightful language of love in communication in
accordance with the sacred Word of the Divine, Veda,
having played their part, go home and retire from life
in peace and tranquillity.
