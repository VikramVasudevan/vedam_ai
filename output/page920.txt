and sinless, be kind to bless us. May Pusha, lord giver
of health and growth, protect us from sin and promote

yamsan.

The army of the brave wears the battle array of a
falcon. Its tooth, 1.e., attack, strikes as a mriga, tiger,
falls upon the game. Equipped with shields and mailed
in armour, passionate for the kill, it falls upon the enemy.
The warriors there fall upon the enemy in united strength
as well as attack in different directions. May the arrows
of this army bring us peace and well-being.

Rjite parivrndhi no’sma bhavatu nastanuh.
Somo’adhi bravitu no’ditih Sarma yacchatu.

May the spirit of health, peace and progress ward
off ills from us all round. May our body be strong as
granite. May soma, spirit of life, inspire us from above.
May the earth as well as the sky bring us peace and
happiness.
