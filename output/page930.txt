Note: In mantras 5-22 in which various aspects
of organised life are listed, there is repetition of ‘asuva’
and ‘parasuva’ from mantra 3, which means: ‘Give us,
we pray, what is good’, and, ‘Remove, we pray, what is

Also, there are echoes of ‘havamahe’ from mantra
4, which means: ‘We invoke and develop’, and, ‘we
challenge and fight out’. This is the call for action under
the divine eye.
