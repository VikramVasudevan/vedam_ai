bond with you, you proceed to us with all the gifts and
blessings for us. Saddle your horses fast, Indra. Rise

Mano nvahvamahe nardsSamsena stomena.

With the contribution of our predecessors,
continuous sacrifice and dedication of our colleagues,
and the generous resources of our seniors, we
concentrate on the mind to develop its power and
potential all round.

आ Ast मन: Ua: क्रत्वे cata जीवसें ।
Fae च सूर्य` FT ॥५४॥

A na’ etu manah punah kratve daksdya jivase.
Jyok ca suryam drSe.

May the mind, seat of memory, come to us whole
and entire, again and again, from birth to birth across
time, for continuous and cumulative retention of
knowledge, karma and sanskaras — seeds and
impressions of thoughts, actions and ideas — for
growing strength and competence, for increasing health
and longevity of life and for a constant vision of the
Sun, the Supreme Spirit of life and the universe.
