Athaitanastau virupandlabhate ’tidirgham

kitavah klibo’sudra’ abrahmanaste prajapatyah.

The good human being accepts and works with
these eight classes of people of different forms and
colours: too tall, too short, too fat, too thin, too white,
too dark, too hairless, too hairy. Also they are neither
Brahmanas nor Shudras (nor the others). They too, all
of them, are children of God, Prajapati. Even the bastard
and the ‘despicable’, the wanton, the gambler, and the
coward and the eunuch, neither Shudras nor Brahmanas
(nor the others), they too are children of God, Prajapati,
father of all.
