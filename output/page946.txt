912 YAJURVEDA

The Brahmana, man of divine vision and Vedic
Word, is the mouth of the Samrat Purusha, the human
community. The Kshatriya, man of justice and polilty,
is created as the arms of defence. The Vaishya, who
produces food and wealth for the society, is the thighs.
And the man of sustenance and support with labour is
the Shudra who bears the burden of the human family.

12. (Purusha Devata, Narayana Rshi)

Candrama manaso jatascaksoh suryo’ajayata.

Srotradvayusca pranasca mukhdadagnirajayata.

The moon is born of the cosmic mind, the sun is

born of the eye, the air and prana energy is born from
the ear, and the fire is born from the mouth.

13. (Purusha Devata, Narayana Rshi)
नाभ्यां s आसीदन्तरिंक्ष: sitet et: सर्मवर्त्तत ।
पद्भ्यां भूमिर्दिश: श्रोत्रात्तर्था लोकां२॥ऽर्जकल्पयन् ॥१३॥

Nabhya’asidantariksam sirsno dyauh sama-
varttata. Padbhyam bhumirdisah srotrattatha
lokan’akalpayan.

The Rishis visualise that the sky was born of the
navel of the Cosmic Purusha, that is, the sky is the navel
part of the universe, the heaven of light arose from the
head, the earth solidified from the dust of the feet, the
space directions emanated from the ear, and similarly
the other regions of the universe arose from the Purusha.

14. (Purusha Devata, Narayana Rshi)

यत्पुरुंषेण gfast देवा यज्ञमर्तन्वत |
वसन्तोऽस्यासीदार्ज्य ग्रीष्मऽइध्म: शरद्धवि:।॥१४॥
