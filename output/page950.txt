916 YAJURVEDA

brilliance of the sun beyond the dark. Having realized
Him only does man transcend the world of existence,
birth and death. There is no other way than this to the
final freedom of Moksha.

19. (Aditya Devata, Uttara Narayana Rshi)
प्रजार्पतिश्चरति गर्भेऽअन्तरर्जायमानो agen वि र्जायते ।
wea योनिं परिं पश्यन्ति धीरास्तस्मिंन्ह तस्थुर्भुर्वनानि
विश्वां ॥१९॥

Prajapatiscarati garbhe’antarajayamano
bahudha vi jayate. Tasya yonim pari pasyanti
dhirastasmin ha tasthurbhuvanani visva.

Prajapati, father spirit of the created universe,
immanent deep in the soul, moves everywhere, and
although ever unborn He variously manifests Himself with
all the forms of life. Men of thought and wisdom feel His
presence manifest all round. In Him alone do all the
worlds of existence find their haven and repose.

20. (Surya Devata, Uttara Narayana Rshi)

यो gastsatadta यो देवार्ना पुरोहित:।
पूर्वो यो eavat जातो sat रुचाय arate Ron

Yo devabhya’atapati yo devanam purohitah.
Purvo yo devebhyo jato namo rucaya brahmaye.

That which blazes with the sun for the divinities
such as the earth, who is the high-priest and prime mover
of the generous excellencies of the world, who rises
first and foremost for the nobilities of the world, to that
divine light our homage and offer of reverence.
