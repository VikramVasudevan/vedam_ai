932 YAJURVEDA

Agni, scholar, ruler, rise and assert yourself for
honour and prosperity. May your power and fame rise
to the heights. Make the home and family happy and
disciplined full of conjugal felicity. Face the enermys’
powers and fix them all round.

13. (Vishvedeva Devata, Bharadvaja Rshi)

chests मन्द्रर्तममर्कशोकैर्ववरृमहे महिं a: श्रोर्ष्यग्ने । इन्द्रं
न त्वा शार्वसा देवर्ता are dora रार्धसा नृर्तमा: ॥१३॥

Tvam hi mandratamamarkasokairvavrmahe
mahi nah srosyagne. Indram na tva Savasa
devata vayum prnanti radhasa nrtamah.

Agni, joyous and great, we approach you with
songs of praise and flames of fire. You alone listen to
our pious words of solemnity. Brilliant as the sun,
powerful as the wind, the noblest of humanity serve
you whole-heartedly with their power and potential, love
and reverence.

14. (Vidvans Devata, Vasishtha Rshi)

Tve’agne svahuta priyasah santu surayah.
Yantaro ye maghavano jananamurvan dayanta

Agni, honoured with praise and served with
flames of fragrant fire, may all the heroes and scholars
be dear to you, all those self-controlled leaders of people
blessed with power and prosperity who suppress the
destroyers of cows and support the development of
animal wealth.
