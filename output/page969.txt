CHAPTER-XXXIII 935

Gava’upavatavatam mahi yajnasya rapsuda.
Ubha karna hiranyaya.

The rays of the sun and the cows both sustain
and preserve the earth, and heaven and earth give form
to the yajna and guard it closely. So may Indra and Vayu,
both of good and golden ear, listen to our prayer and
protect and promote yajna.

20. (Savita Devata, Vasishtha Rshi)

यद्द्य सूरऽउदितेऽरनांगा fatsstaar |
सुवातिं सविता wt: ॥२०॥

Yadadya ऽप्रा`त` udite’naga mitro’aryama. Suvati
savita bhagah.

To-day when the sun has arisen, then the
immaculate Mitra, friend of all, Aryama, lord of justice,
Savita, lord of life, and Bhaga, lord of glory and
prosperity, inspire, energise and bless the world.

21. (Vena Devata, Suniti Rshi)

आ aa सिंञ्चत fora रोर्दस्योरभिश्रिर्यम् |
रसा deta वृषभम् । तं प्रत्नर्था । अयं वेन: ॥२१॥

A sute sificata Sriyain rodasyorabhisriyam. Rasa
dadhita vrsabham. Tam pratnatha’ yam venah.

In this holy yajnic world of the Lord, consecrate
the light and glory of the sun which shines over the
beauty of heaven and earth. May all the essences of
nature and the best of humanity hold on to this flood of
light and life. The wisest of the ancients consecrated
and worshipped it, this light and wisdom of the world.
