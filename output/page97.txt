64 YAJURVEDA

Tryambakam yajamahe sugandhim pusti-
vardhanam. Urvarukamiva bandhanan-
mrtyormukstya ma’mrtat. Tryambkam yajamahe
sugandhim pativedanam. Urvarukamiva
bandhandadito mukstya mamutah.

We worship Rudra, Lord of the Universe,
constant and invariable in all the three phases of time,
and the first cause of health, growth, prosperity and
happiness. May we, with His grace, be released from
the bonds of death into freedom, immortality and eternal
joy (ananda), just as the ripe fruit of melon falls off
from the stalk on the branch to fullness and freedom.
And may we never fall off from the state of freedom,
immortality and eternal joy in the company of the Lord.
We worship the Lord, Rudra, constant and invariable
through time, purest and purifying, sustainer and
protector who reveals Himself to His devotees. May
He with His grace release us from the bonds of mortality
here just as the melon fruit is released from the stalk,
but we may never fall off from freedom, immortality,
ananda and the presence of the Lord.

61. (Rudra Devata, Vasishtha Rshi)

Udd रुद्रावसं at परो मूर्जवतोऽर्तीहि 1 अर्वततधन्वा
पिर्नाकावस: क्त्तिवासाऽअर्हिश्सन्न: शिवोऽर्तीहि ॥६१॥

Etatte rudravasam tena paro mujavato’ tihi.
Avatatadhanva pinakavasah_ krttivasa’
ahimsannah Sivo ’tthi.

Rudra, warrior of the bow in readiness, strong in
position with shield and armour, this is the way you
defend and protect. Come down from the mountain
heights and be with us wholly. Hurt us not, be good and
kind and gracious.
