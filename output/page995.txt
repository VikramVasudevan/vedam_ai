CHAPTER-XXXIII 961

Tadidasa bhuvanesu jyestham yato jajna’
ugrastvesanrmnah. Sadyo jajnano ni rindati
Satrunanu yam visve madantyumah.

That alone is the highest and most exalted in the
world of existence whence the awful sunlike hero of
blazing power is born. Upon the rise, he instantly
destroys the enemies such as darkness. All protective
powers of the world rejoice with him.

81. (Vishvedeva Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

gust त्वा asad fint ada या ud |
पावकरवर्णा: ypetar विपङ्चितोऽभि स्तोरमैरनूषत ॥८१॥

Ima@’u tva puruvaso giro vardhantu ya mama.
Pavakavarnah sucayo vipascito’bhi stomai-
ranusata.

Lord omnipresent, all inspiring, these addresses
of mine which celebrate and exalt you may inspire the
wise divines who, brilliant and pure like sacred fire, do
homage to you with hymns of praise.

82. (Vishvedeva Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

wera विश्वऽआर्यो ard: ङेवधिपाऽअरि:।
`तिरङ्चिदर्ये रुशमे पर्वीरवि qacaissizaed रयि:॥८ २॥।

Yasyayam visva’aryo dasah sevadhipa’arih.
TiraScidarye rusame paviravi tubhyetso’ajyate
rayih.

The noble people of the world are obedient
supporters of yours. The treasurer is pious and faithful.
And whatever is treasured or hoarded or hidden with
the trader, the violent man or the armed guard, all that
is wealth preserved for you ultimately.
