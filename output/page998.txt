Ashvins, powers of health and joy, come and join
us (ruler and people both), beatify our yajna and drink
of the honey-sweets of fragrance. Virile and generous
lords and pillars of wealth and victory, come with a
shower of milk and waters, neglect us never.

May Brahmanaspati, lord of wealth and
knowledge, come and bless us. May the divine voice of
truth and rectitude enlighten us and bless our speech.
May the sagely scholars conduct our yajna for the
attainment of common good and rise of the good, and
brave and noble people of the community.
