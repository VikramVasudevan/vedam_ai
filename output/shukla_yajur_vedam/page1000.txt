966 YAJURVEDA

The great universal Agni sanctified in heavenly
light grows with the earth and, raised and exalted with
holy food, kind and favourable to humanity, dispels the
darkness with its light and glory.

93. (Indragni Devate, Suhotra Rshi)

इन्द्रांग्नीऽअपादियं पूर्वार्गात्पद्वतीभ्य: |
हित्वी fort जिह्वया वार्वदच्चरत्तिश्शत्पदा र्न्यक्रमीत् ॥९३॥

Indragni’ apddiyam purvagat padvatibhyah.
Hitvi siro jihvaya vavadaccharat trimsatpada
nyakramit.

Indra and Agni, powers of light and fire, this
dawn, radiating, not walking, from the heights of
heaven, descends (to the earth), first in the morning,
for the moving humanity. It speaks with the tongue of
birds and humans, walks on for thirty steps of the thirty-
muhurta (twenty four hour) day, and then re-turns in
the diurnal course.

94. (Vishvedeva Devata, Manu Rshi)

देवासो fe ष्मा wa समन्यवो faved साक: सररांतय:।
a नोंऽअद्य asstat get तु नो भर्वन्तु वरिवोविर्दं:॥९४॥

Devaso hi sma manave samanyavo visve sakain
saratayah. Te no’adya te’aparam tuce tu no
bhavantu varivovidah.

May all the noble saints and scholars and men of
wealth and power, zealous and generous, together be
liberal and kind to the entire humanity. May they be
givers of freedom and prosperity to us to-day, and
comfort and advancement to our children to morrow.
