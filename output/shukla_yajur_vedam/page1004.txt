CHAPTER-XXXIV

(Mana Devata, Shivasankalpa Rshi)

ज्योर्तिषां ज्योतिरेकं तन्मे मर्न: शिवर्सङ्कल्पमस्तु ॥१॥

Yajjagrato duramudaiti daivam tadu suptasya
tathaivaiti. Durangamam jyotisam jyotirekam
tanme manah Sivasankalpamastu.

The ‘Daiva mind’, perceptive faculty of the

intelligent soul, which in the waking state goes far and
shines, which in the dream state also roams around the
same way and takes us far, that one unique light of lights,
that mind of mine, I pray, be full of noble thoughts,
intentions and resolutions.

(Mana Devata, Shivasankalpa Rshi)
adud यक्षमन्त: प्रजानां तन्मे मर्न: शिवर्सङ्कल्पमस्तु ॥२॥

Yena karmanyapaso manisino yajne krnvanti
vidathesu dhirah. Yadapurvam yaksamantah
prajanam tanme manah Sivasankalpamastu.

The ‘Yaksha mind’, volitional faculty, by which

men of action, thought and constancy organise and
perform all acts in yajnic programmes of life, the
matchless faculty, present in all people, may that mind
of mine, I pray, be full of noble thoughts, intentions
and resolutions.
