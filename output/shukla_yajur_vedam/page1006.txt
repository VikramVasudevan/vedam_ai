CHAPTER-XXXIV 971

Yasminnrcah sama yajumsi yasmin pratisthita
rathanabhavivarah. Yasminscittam sarvamotam
prajanam tanme manah Sivasankalpamastu.

The mind in which are woven Riks, hymns of
knowledge, Yajus, hymns of application, and Samans,
hymns of celebration and devotion (and the hymns of
divinity), in which they are inter-fixed like spokes in
the nave of a wheel, in which the Chitta, memory and
unconscious of all the people, is inter-woven, may that
mind of mine, I pray, be full of noble thoughts, intentions
and resolutions.

6. (Mana Devata, Shivasankalpa Rshi)

सुषारथिरश्वांनिव ayaa s eras seat ।

मस्तु ell

Susdarathirasvaniva yanmanusyanneniyate’

bhisubhirvajina iva. Hrtpratistham yadajiram

javistham tanme manah sivasankalpamastu.

The mind which leads people by stimulation of

the senses like a good driver controlling fast moving
horses with bridle strings, which abides in the heart,
which is unageing and fastest in motion, may that mind
of mine, I pray, be full of noble thoughts, intentions
and resolutions.

7. (Anna Devata, Agastya Rshi)

Pitum nu stosam maho dharmanam tavisim.
Yasya trito vyojasa vrtram viparvamardayat.
