Early morning we invoke Bhaga, and pray for
honour and prosperity, Bhaga, all victorious, lustrous
child of immortality and sustainer of the social system,
which everybody — whether poor and helpless, or fast
and impetuous, or a ruling king — loves and honours,
and of which the Lord of Life says: Acquire honour
and glory won by effort and endeavour and enjoy.

Lord of glory, lord of inspiration for
advancement, lord of truth and beneficence, lord of light
and knowledge, blessed us as you have with intelligence,
we pray, save this intelligence of ours from sin and lead
us to the vision of divinity. Lord of power and prosperity,
