988 YAJURVEDA

inviolable and intrepidable protector, sustaining the laws
of existence and maintaining the sustainers of life such
as earth and sun, takes the three steps of creation through
the causal Prakriti, subtle materials, and the concrete
forms of life and matter. Hence He alone is the lord
adorable.

44, (Vishnu Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

तद्विप्रांसो faaaat जागृवाश्जंस: सर्मिन्धते ।
विष्णोर्यत्परमं पदम् ॥४४॥

Tadvipraso vipanyavo jagrvaisah samindhate.
Visnoryatparamam padam.

That which is the highest stage of human
attainability is Vishnu’s divinity. That is what the sages,
celebrants, ever wakeful among humanity, meditate,
light up, realise and live.

45. (Dyava-prithivi Devate, Bharadvaja Rshi)

magia ator efor विष्कंभितेऽअजरे भूरिं-
रेतसा ॥४७५॥

Ghrtavati bhuvananam abhisriyorvi prthvi
madhudughe supesasa. Dyavaprthivi varunasya
dharmana viskabhite’ajare bhuriretasa.

By the eternal power and existential law of
Varuna, Lord Supreme, are sustained firmly the sun and
the earth together, both unageing, mighty prolific,
abundant in living waters, glory of the worlds, wide,
expansive, full of honey sweets and wondrous beautiful.
