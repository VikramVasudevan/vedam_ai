CHAPTER-XXXV 997

Vayuh punatu savita punatvagnerbhrdajasa
suryasya varcasa vimucyantamusriyah.

May the wind purify you. May Savita, lord of
light, purify you with the blazing heat of agni and the
light of the sun. And may the rays of light deliver you
from bondage.

4. (Vayu & Savita Devate, Adityas or Devas Rshis)
अश्वत्थे at निषर्दनं पर्णे at वसतिष्कृता |
गोभाजऽइत्किर्लासथ चयत्सनर्वथ Gea isi

Asvatthe vo nisadanam parne vo vasatiskrta.
Gobhaja itkilasatha yatsanavatha purusam.

Short is your stay in a temporary world. Your nest
is built but on a leaf. Live here as co-sharers of existence
with the earth, the senses, the sun-beams and the divine
Word, and abide in worship close to the eternal Spirit
of the universe.

5. (Vayu & Savita Devate, Adityas or Devas Rshis)

सविता ते शरीराणि मातुरुपस्थऽआर्वपतु |
wet पृथिवि seta iq

Savita te Sartrani maturupastha’a vapatu.
Tasmai prthivi Sambhava.

May Savita, lord of creation and generation, plant
your bodies in the womb of the mother and seat you on
her lap of love.

Mother, mother earth, Mother Nature, be kind
and gracious to this soul.
