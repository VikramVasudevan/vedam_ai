1014 YAJURVEDA

Sumitriya na’apa’osadhayah santu durmi-
triyastasmai santu. Yo’sman dvesti yam ca
vayam dvismah.

May the waters, pranic energies and herbs be
friendly tonics for us, and may they be antidotes to
whatsoever hates and injures us and what we hate and
disapprove. (Prayer for health against negativities.)

24. (Surya Devata, Dadhyangatharvana Rshi)

That light divine, blissful to the divinities, pure
and wide awake since eternity, may we continue to see
for a full hundred years, live under its benign eye for a
hundred years, hear for a hundred years, speak and
celebrate for a hundred years, and be fit and fine in a
state of freedom and independence for a hundred years,
and even more than a hundred years!
