15. (Agni Devata, Dadhyangatharvana Rshi)

eafarhaat गत सं दैर्वेन सवित्रा सश्सूर्य`णारोचिष्ट ।
स्वाहा समग्निस्तर्पसा wa सं dala सवित्रा सश्सूर्य`णा-
स्करुचत ॥१७५॥

Samagniragnina gata sam daivena savitra sain
suryenarocista. Svaha samgnistapasa gata sam
daivyena savitra sam suryenarurucata.

Agni, heat and vitality of fire, burns and shines
in the world in unison with Agni, universal heat and
light of Divinity, in unison with the Supreme Savita,
creator of life (from whom the heat and vitality emanates
to the fire), and in unison with the brilliant sun (who
receives the emanation of light from Savita and radiates
it to the fire).

Agni, Supreme Creator of light and life, pervades
the heat of fire, being one with it; inspires the divine
creative and generative power of nature, being one with
it, and blazes as one with the sun, and thus illuminates
the universe with His self-effulgent glory.

This is the voice of Divinity, in truth of word and
deed.

र्मर्त्सस्तपोजा:। वार्चमस्मे Frees देवायुर्वम् ॥१६॥
Dharta divo vi bhati tapasasprthivyam dharta

devo devanamamartyastapojah. Vacamasme ni
yaccha devayuvam.

The self-effulgent wielder of the heavens,
controller of the heat and light of the universe, sustainer
