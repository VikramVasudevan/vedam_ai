1026 YAJURVEDA

Lord creator and sustainer of the worlds of the
universe, lord of the dynamics of universal mind, lord
of the universal voice of knowledge, lord protector of
the speech of humanity, listener of the voice of
nobilities, lord of light, self-effulgent, save the divinities
of nature and blessed souls of humanity.

Teacher and preacher, may the lord protect you
both for the sake of divine gifts of knowledge and virtue.

Give us the sweets of life with the months of
spring. Give us the sweets of knowledge and science
by the hands of Ashvinis.

19. (Ishvara Devata, Atharvana Rshi)

ge त्वा मर्नसे त्वा faa त्वा gala त्वा ।
Reatsstet fafa gad धेहि ॥१९॥

Hrde tva manase tva dive tva surydaya tva.
Urdhvo’adhvaram divi devesu dhehi.

Lord and Light of the universe, for the purity of
heart, for the enlightenment of mind, for the bliss of
heaven and gift of energy, and for the light of the sun
and knowledge of the stars, we meditate on you and the
divine knowledge. Lord highest of existence, advance
our yajna of love and non-violence among the divinities
of nature and humanity and bless it that it may rise to
the heavens.

त्वष्टृमन्तस्त्वा सपेम पुत्रान् पशून् मयिं धेहि प्रजामस्मारसु
