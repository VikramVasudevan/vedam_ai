fragrant gifts of yajna from the holy materials offered
into the sacred fire.

So also the highpriest sitting south of the vedi
should offer homage of yajna for all the directions of
space and all the divinities of nature and humanity.

11. (Yajna Devata, Dirghatama Rshi)
fafa atsga यज्ञमिमं aa दिवि at:
स्वाहाग्नरये यज्ञियांय शं aust: gen
Divi dha’imam yajnamimam yajnam divi dhah.
Svaha’gnaye yajniyaya sam yajurbhyah.

Men and women, wedded couples, pursue this
yajna of home life, society and sacrificial ritual
wakefully in the light of the day and raise it to the regions
of the sun. Offer oblations to Agni in truth of word and
deed. Perform yajna with verses of Yajurveda for the
lovers of Yajurveda and let it emanate peace and
fragrance all round.

12. (Ashvinau Devate, Dirghatama Rshi)
stivaat घर्मं पांतश्हाद्बीनमहर्दिवार्भिस्कतिर्भि: ।
तन्त्रायिणे नमो द्यावापृथिवीभ्याम् ॥१२॥

Asvina gharmam patam hardvanamahardiva-
bhirutibhih. Tantradyine namo dyavaprthivi-
bhyam.

Ashvins, men and women, wedded couples,
promote yajna with all kinds of protection and support
day and nigh, and offer homage to the earth and heaven
and to the sun, mover of the wheel of time. Yajna is so
dear to the heart, so blissful to the soul.
