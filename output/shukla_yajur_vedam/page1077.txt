1042 YAJURVEDA

Lord of infinite peace and joy, for the human
observance and extension of your cosmic yajna I am
one with your light and splendour, lord of omnipotence
and bliss of life. And having invoked and fed the fire of
yajna, inspired and sanctified by the holy fire, I taste
the honey-sweets of yajna raised by the waves of Indra’s
energy, and consumed, revitalized and showered by the
sun, father and guardian of the children of divinity.
