The soul comes to attain and hold Agni by the
heart, electric energy by the front part of the heart,
Pashupati Shiva by the whole heart, the kind Shiva by
the liver, the fearsome Shiva by sides of the heart, ruling
power by righteous anger, the great lord by ribs on both
sides of the chest, heat and light of spirits by the
intestines, manly excellence by the ventricles of the
heart.

The soul comes to have hypertension by the
blood, friendliness by noble thoughts and values,
violence by negative thoughts and values, honour and
power by good conduct, strong people by power, good
people and success by love and cheerfulness. Sweetness
of the throat is the seat of praise and social appreciation.
Inside of the ribs is the seat of Rudra. The liver is the
seat of Mahadeva. The intestines are the seat of strength.
The arteries of the heart are the seat of Pashupati.
