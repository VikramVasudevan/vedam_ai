About Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma's English translation
of the Yajurveda

I feel myself fortunate and blest with the Grace of God that
I received a few pages of the English translation by Dr. Tulsi
Ram Sharma with introduction of the Yajurveda. The comparative
views expressed by him about the Vedas are essential for every
student of the Veda since it is a further pointer to scientific research
in the field of Vedic interpretation.

Its conclusion is true: "In short Veda is an eternal articulation
of omniscience, the voice of God". Each work of Prasthana Trayi
i.e. Vedanta, Upanishads and Gita is not a take off from the Vedas
but a continuation of Vedic studies in its own context of
meditation, meditative teaching and a rousing call to action in a
situation of karmic crisis. This English translation is a welcome
addition to Vedic studies opening truly a new path establishing
with ease the Vedas in the service of humanity.
