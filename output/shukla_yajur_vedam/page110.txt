CHAPTER-IV 77

Anu tva mata manyatamanu pita’nu bhrata
sagarbhyo’nu sakha sayuthyah. Sa devi
devamacchehindraya somam rudrastva
varttayatu svasti somasakha punarehi.

May your mother approve and bless your pursuit
of energy and the literature of knowledge. May your
father permit and bless and help, may your brother agree
and support, may your friend in the community consent
and cooperate in your project. May that goddess of light
and energy come and bless you with sweet success in
your programme for the glory of Indra and the happiness
of humanity with beneficent means of comfort and well-
being. May the Lord of justice and love inspire you.
May the scholar of Rudra discipline and knowledge
guide you. May success and honour come to you again
and again, friend of humanity and devotee of the Lord
Supreme, for the sake of life and the environment.

21. (Vak & Vidyut Devate, Vatsa Rshi)
वस्व्यस्यदितिरस्यादित्यासिं रुद्रासिं चन्द्रारसिं ।
बरृहस्पर्तिष्ट्वा सुम्ने रम्णातु रुद्रो THATS Ue

Vasvyasyaditirasyadityasi rudrasi candrasi.
Brhaspatistva sumne ramnatu rudro vasubhi-
racake.

This energy and the language (which you pursue)
pertains to the heat of agni that supports life on earth,
pursued by scholars of twenty four years discipline. It
relates to the pranic energy of life, pursued by scholars
of forty-four years discipline. It pertains to the solar
radiation, pursued by scholars of forty-eight years
discipline. It is blissful as the light of the moon. It is
correct and beneficent like the justice and love of Rudra,
