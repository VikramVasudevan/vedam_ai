For the love of the people I adore the lord of light,
creator of earth and heaven and the middle regions of
the skies, the eternal poet who composed this wonderful
world of paradisal beauty and truth adorned with the
jewels of life from His inexhaustible treasure of nature,
lord so dear to the learned and the wise, the brilliant
manifestation of whose existential form blazes in the
heaven above and the earth below which He made. With
His infinite mercy He created the regions of bliss for
the people, the creatures He created and loved. The
people adore you, lord, with their breath of life. Lord of
the golden bough in both hands, bless the people with
the breath and energy of life existential as well as eternal.
