Friend of friends, man of knowledge and wisdom,
come, be friends with us. Pleasant and aspiring, come
along, sit on the right side of Indra, lord of power and
wealth and knowledge. Gentle and decent, come to the
gentle and the decent. Persuasive teacher, guardian of
Soma, brilliant, fearsome to the wicked and the non-
serious wasters, smiling, versatile, dominant master,
defend and protect those who value the gifts of Soma
and knowledge. Let no one bully you.

Agni, Lord of light and life, save me all round from
