88 YAJURVEDA

Agnerjanitramasi vrsanau stha’ urvasyasya-
yurasi pururava’ asi. Gayatrena tva chandasa
manthami traistubhena tva chandasa manthami
jJagatena tva chandasa manthami.

Yajna (yajna materials), you are the birth-place
of fire, source power of fire-arms. You are the food of
the cosmic agents of rain, air and the sun. You are the
producer and provider of various comforts of life. You
are the secret of the knowledge of the Shastras through
learned gatherings. I refine and kindle the fire with the
inspiring chant of the Gayatri verses. I invigorate you
and raise the fire with the exhilarating chant of the
Trishtubh verses. I boost you and rouse the fire with
the ecstatic chant of the jagati verses.

3. (Yajna Devata, Gotama Rshi)
भर्वतं a: सर्मनसौ aeaarerual i मा यज्ञश्हिश्सिष्टं
मा यज्ञर्पतिं जातवेदसौ शिवौ र्भवतमद्य र्न: nan
Bhavatam nah samanasau sacetasdvarepasau.
Ma yajnam him sistam ma yajnapatim
jatavedasau Sivau bhavatamadya nah.

May the teacher and the disciple of the science
of yajna be of equal mind in teaching and learning,
harmonious in knowledge and instructions, gentle and
free from coarseness in manners and communication.
May these two devotees of the fire of yajna be auspicious
harbingers of peace and happiness for us. May they not
disturb or ruin the yajna. May they not hurt the yajnapati.

4. (Agni Devata, Gotama Rshi)

अग्नावग्निश्चरति प्रविष्टऽऋषींणां पुत्रोऽरअभिशस्तिपार्वा।

स र्न: स्योन: gas यजेह देवेभ्यों हव्यश्सदमरप्रयुच्छन्त्
स्वारहा ॥४॥
