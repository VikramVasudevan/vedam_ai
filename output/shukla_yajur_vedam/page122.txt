CHAPTER-V 89

Agnavagniscarati pravista’ rsinam putro’
abhisastipava. Sa nah syonah suyaja yajeha
devebhyo havyam sadamaprayucchantsvaha.

Agni (fire) present in agni (electricity) is
universally active and operative. Deeply involved in the
study of agni, child of the rshis of scholarship, one with
his subject, graceful, enlightened, serious and dedicated,
the teacher and researcher roams around with his love.
May he, for us here, carry on the yajna of his project
with the libations of his special materials and create
new knowledge and food for further yajna.
