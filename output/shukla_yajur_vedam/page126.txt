Agni (fire, electricity and light) is the bringer of
home for the homeless and wealth for all. It saves from
destitution and exploitation, and from fear and
deprivation. Know this agni: it is water from the sky,
lives in the body parts as vital heat and comes bearing
the name of health and longevity. It lives in this earth
and that is its yajnic and indestructible form. For that
reason, we light it in the vedi, raise it and feed it for the
attainment of noble virtues.

virtues.
