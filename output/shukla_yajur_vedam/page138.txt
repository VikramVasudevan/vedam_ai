Yajna, man of knowledge, president of the
assembly, reach the regions of light and reveal the
secrets of knowledge. Rise to the skies and fill the space
there for knowledge. Reach into the earth and strengthen
it. May the wind join you and help with the light of
energy. May the two-fold movements of wind-energy,
prana and apana, help you with their firm and unfailing
power. I know and appreciate your dedication to
knowledge and education, to governance and
organization, to the economic system and wish you well.
Promote knowledge, strengthen the social system, enrich
the economic system. Promote life and health. Promote
the welfare of the people.
