106 YAJURVEDA

Lady of the house, hostess of yajna, you are firm
and strong. May the yajamana, your husband, also be
firm in this yajna, in this home, in this world, with his
family, his people and his wealth. May both of you fill
the earth and the sky with the fragrance of ghee and
fertility. You are the protective shade of Indra, lord of
power and prosperity. You too be the protective cover
for all the people of the world.

29. (Ishvara and Sabhadhyaksha Devate, Autathya
Dirghatama Rshi)

परिं त्वा freon गिरंऽड्मा भंवन्तु विश्वर्त: |
Garay Gaga जुष्टां भवन्तु जुष्टय: ॥२९॥

Pari tva girvano gira’ima bhavantu visvatah.
Vrddhayumanu vrddhayo justa bhavantu
Jjustayah.

Lord President, adorable in songs of praise, may
these chants of celebration reach you whole and from
all sides, and may these praises, ever loved, increase
and grow in their truth and value alongwith the lord,
first in time and oldest in wisdom.

30. (Ishvara and Sabhadhyaksha Devate, Madhuchhanda
Rshi)

इन्द्रस्य स्यूरसीन्द्रस्य ध्रुव्रोऽसि ।
ऐन्द्र्मसि वैश्वदेवर्मसि ॥३०॥

Indrasya syurasindrasya dhruvo’si Aindramasi
vaisvadevamasi.

You are the life-link of the world’s beauty and
grandeur. You are the centre-pin of the wheel of
existence. You are the power and the glory. You are the
ultimate rest and haven of the universe.
