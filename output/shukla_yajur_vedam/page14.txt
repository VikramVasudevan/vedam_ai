Message

Above the narrow boundaries of country, time, caste and
creed, the Vedas have been a treasure house of eternal universal
knowledge and spiritual wisdom. There have been numerous
attempts by Indians and foreigners to make the knowledge of
these Vedas available to the people at large. Among them the
Vedic commentaries of the great social and spiritual leader,
Maharshi Dayananda are the best works in this field. Inspired by
Swami Dayananda, the translation of the Yajurveda into English
by Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma is a commendable work in this line.
Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma has been a great devotee of sacred literature,
especially Vedas, Upanishads, and various philosophies. His life
long study of the Vedas has given him deep insight into Vedic
philosophy. His translation of the Yajurveda reveals it fully. Here
he has translated the Yajurveda, the Veda of Karma, in such a
way that even a common reader can grasp its essence. He has
very effectively brought out how this Veda teaches us to apply
spiritual knowledge in practical life. Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma
deserves our congratulations and best wishes for having done
translation of all the four Vedas in simple and clear English for
the international community.
