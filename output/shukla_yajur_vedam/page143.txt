110 YAJURVEDA
36. (Agni Devata, Agastya Rshi)

अग्ने नर्यं gaat रायेऽअस्मान्विश्वांनि देव वयुर्नानि विद्वान्।
युयोध्युस्मर्जजुहुराणमेनो भूर्चिष्ठां ते नर्मऽउक्ति विधेम ॥३६॥

Agne naya supatha raye’ asmanvisvani deva
vayunani vidvan. Yuyodhyasmajjuhuranameno
bhiyistham te nama’uktim vidhema.

Agni, light of the world and treasure-home of all
the power and wealth, lord of all the knowledge, karma
and paths of life, lead us on by the right path, simple
and straight, to the highest goal of life, Moksha, through
right knowledge, right action and right wealth. Fight
out and ward off from us all that is evil and leads to
suffering — crookedness, deviousness, intrigue and
deceit. We bow in thanks and surrender to you and sing
the sweetest songs in praise of you.

37. (Agni Devata, Agastya Rshi)

अयं नोंऽअग्निर्वरिंवस्कृणोत्वयं ge: arstd प्रभिन्दन् |
स्वारहां ॥३७॥

Ayam no’ agnirvarivaskrnotvayam mrdhah

vajasatavayaim Satrunjayatu jarhrsanah svaha.

May this Agni, this fiery man of courage and
prowess, make the way to safety, security, wealth and
bliss. May he, breaking through the lines of the envious,
go forward. May he defeat the enemy in battles and win
the victories. May he, in joyous song, celebrate the
victory for Agni.
