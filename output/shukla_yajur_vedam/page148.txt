In this world of lord Savita’s creation, with both
the arms of Ashwinis (the wind’s energy of prana and
udana) and both the hands of Pusha (the earth’s gift of
strength and prowess), I accept you and consecrate you,
Head of the people and President of the assembly and
your life-partner, in this social yajna. With this
acceptance and investiture, I catch the evil and the
wicked by the neck and destroy them. You are the power
to join and disjoin. Remove the envious from us. Drive
out all poverty and suffering from here. This is the
august assembly of the noble people. May the noble
people sitting in this assembly accept and consecrate
you for the heavens (the light of knowledge), for the
skies (internal purity of conduct), and for the earth
(earthly prosperity and well-being). You are the centre-
seat of the great and the noble ones.
