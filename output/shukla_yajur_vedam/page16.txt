Sadbhavana (Good wishes)

Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma, is a profound scholar of English,
Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu. But his heart felt devotion goes to sacred
literature, especially Vedas, Upanishads, Darshan Philosophy,
Puranas, Ramayana, and Mahabharata with concentration on the
Bhagwad Gita, Greek, Roman, Sumerian and English Epics,
Gathas of Zarathustra, Bible, Quran and the writings of Swami
Dayananda and Swami Vivekananda, in search of the essential
values of Veda and Sanatan Vedic Dharma. It seems his real spirit
and scholarly interest lies in the interpretation of the Vedas. I
have gone through some portions of his English translation of
Yajurveda and on perusal of this translation, I have marked two
characterizing features:

1. His language is perfectly lucid and

2. His translation is faithful to the word and spirit of the
Mantras.

Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma has very correctly observed, "Veda
is knowledge of existence, pure and simple, as Science is
knowledge. Science is the knowledge of nature as nature is and
as it works according to its own laws. In Science, there is no
story, no history. Similarly, in the Vedas, there is no story, no
history. And just as Science is knowledge in Scientific language,
free from local colour and historical variations of form and
meaning, so Veda too is knowledge in scientific language, free
from local colour and historical variations."

Veda is 'Knowledge' and knowledge is eternal. The
interpretation of the Vedas requires the knowledge of the Arsh
technique as explained by the Rshis like Yaska, Panini, Patanjali,
Dayananda and Aurobindo.

As Veda is pure knowledge, so is this translation in theArsh
tradition, free from myth and history with no local colour, no
attitude, no motive, except pure communication of the Original
for all.

With best wishes to the author and specially to the readers,
