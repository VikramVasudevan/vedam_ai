CHAPTER-VI 129

Havismatirima’ apo havisman’ avivasati.
Havisman devo’ adhvaro havisman’ astu suryah.

The waters are a blessing carrying the purity and
joy of yajna. May the wind too bless us with the gifts of
yajna. May yajna, non-violent, a very god of love and
peace, overflow with life-giving fragrance. May the sun
be replete and generous with the light and life of yajna.

24. (Apah Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

अग्नेर्वोऽर्पन्नगृहस्य सर्दसि सादयामीन्द्राग्न्योर्भीगधेयीं स्थ
मित्रावरुंणयोर्भागधेयीं ca विश्वेषां carat भागधेयीं स्थ।
अमूर्याऽउप wa यार्भिर्वा get: we iat at हिन्वन्त्व-

yorbhagadheyi stha visvesam devanam
bhagadheyi stha. Amurya’ upa surye yabhirva

Brahmacharini/s, unmarried graduands, I settle
you in the home/s (refined and cultured with education
and learning) of the unmarried graduate/s bright as Agni
in marriage according to your own choice. You know
the virtues and advantages of sun and fire. You know
the properties of prana and udana (forms of pranic
energy). You know the nature and learning of the
scholars and you know the properties of the powers of
nature such as earth and others. Be partners in their
blessings in your life. And those who imbibe the virtues
of the sun and whom the light and life of the sun has
already blessed, we invite to grace this marital yajna of
ours.
