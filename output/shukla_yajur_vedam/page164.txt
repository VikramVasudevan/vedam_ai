CHAPTER-VI 131

intelligent, educated and cool-minded women listen, like
mothers, to the prayers of women. Man of reverence
and wisdom, listen to our prayers like the yajnic chants
of learned and faithful devotees. May Savita, lord of
power and light, listen to my prayers and words of praise.

27. (Apah Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

देवीरापोऽअपान्नपाद्यो र्वऽऊर्मिर्हविष्यऽइन्द्रियार्वान् मदिनन्तम:।
तं देवेभ्यो देवत्रा da शुक्रपेभ्यो येरषा भाग स्थ स्वार्हा॥२७॥

Devirapo’apamnapdadyo va’ urmirhavisya’
indriyavan madintamah. Tam devebhyo devatra
datta sukrapebhyo yesam bhaga stha svaha.

Noble and intelligent people, to one who, among
you, is of good and constant character, strong of sense
and will, happiest and most inspiring, like a wave on
the ocean of existence, worthy of reverence and homage,
defender and supporter of the virtuous, to him, for the
gods among men, the noblest preservers, protectors and
promoters of life’s vitalities, give your share of the social
yajnic offering. You too are a part of the noble ones.
Accept him in good grace with words of love and
reverence — the one of you and for all of you.

कार्षिरसि समुद्रस्य त्वा क्षिंत्याऽउन्नयामि ।
समार्पोऽअद्भिरंग्मत समोर्षधीभिरोर्षधी: ॥२८॥

Karsirasi samudrasya tva ksitya’ unnayami.
Samapo’ adbhiragmata samosdhibhirosadhih.
You are the farmer. I exhort you to fill the sky

with the vapours of water for the enrichment of the earth
and the sea. With the oblations of herbs into the fire,
