In this world of Lord Savita’s creation, with both
the arms of Ashvinis (power and vitality of sun and
moon) and with both the hands of Pusha (the nourishing
virtues of mother earth’s herbs), I accept you. You are
the giver. In the service of Indra, lord and ruler of this
land, with the best and most graceful words of piety,
enrich and expand this non-violent social yajna of love
and good fellowship, so deep and full with blessings,
so generous with milk and honey, health and energy
