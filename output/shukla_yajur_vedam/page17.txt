To the Reader

This translation of the ‘Hymns of Yajurveda’ is an English
Version of the Yajurveda for the common reader who wants to
acquaint himself or herself with the content of this divine message
of the dynamics of Karma, both human and divine, in the context
of the nature, structure and purpose of the universe and the
condition and position of the human being in it. While the opening
mantra launches the human being on life with the exhortation:
“Be vibrant as the winds”, the closing mantra seals the success of
vibrant humanity in action with the final achievement of “Om
Kham Brahma” with Grace Divine.

Life according to the Yajurveda is a journey from the
beginning-less beginning to the endless end with the message:

Immortal child of Divinity,

Your roots go deep to Eternity,
Your reach is unto Infinity.

And your path is up and onwards,
Never never downwards.

This version is a scientific translation of the text within the
parameters of Yaska and Dayananda with rational understanding
of Sayana at the one end and the western scholars at the other.
Sayana’s translation is ritualistic especially with reference to yajna.
It came at a time when the “Renaissance, Re-awakening of
Learning” was far off, not yet just at the next door. Even
communication between the East and the West was not as hectic
as it became after the advent of the East India Company into India.
Thus mutual criticism and appreciation too was silent rather than
vocal. Hence Ritualism was just the thing acceptable to a society
settled on the side of stagnation more than of fermentation.

Ritual, of course, is sacred. It is the most meticulous
programme of action in pursuit of a holistic plan of life and living
