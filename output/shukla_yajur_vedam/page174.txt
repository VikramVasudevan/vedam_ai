yoga, are anxious to reach you. Come by these, come to
us. Disciple of yoga, accepted you are in the discipline
of yoga for success like the wind. Yoga is your home
alongwith Indra and Vayu (power of the mind and purity
of the soul). You are the favourite of both Indra and
Vayu. With the love and power of these two, I love you
too with reverence.
