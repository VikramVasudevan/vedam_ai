CHAPTER-VII 143

Teacher and seeker, with your control over the
vital energies of prana and apana, and for the sweetness
and light of your spiritual awareness, we do reverence
and homage to you.

Yogi, established you are in the rules of yamas
and niyamas, the discipline of social and personal purity.
This is your natural element, a very home and blessed
state of being.

Cleansed of ignorance and suffering, peaceful at
heart, you explore, follow and advance in that state of
yoga which, like that of the ancient Rshis and yogis old
and new, is supreme, powerful, instant and victorious,
remover of negativities, shaker of sin and giver of
strength, and which is the light residing in the deepest
cave of the heart. Man of love and peace, protect this
state of strength and purity invincible for yourself. And
may the powers of the divine, saviours and protectors
of life and energy, be with you and lead you on.
