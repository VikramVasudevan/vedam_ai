144 YAJURVEDA

13. (Vishvedeva Devata, Vatsara Kashyapa Rshi)

Want वीरान् प्रजनयन् परीह्यभि रायस्पोषॆण यर्जमानम् ।

BUS: शुक्रस्याधिष्ठार्नमसि ॥१३॥

Suviro  viradn prajanayan parthyabhi
rayasposena yajamanam. Sanjagmano diva
prthivya Sukrah sukrasocisa nirastah sandah
Sukrasyadhisthanamasi.

You are good and bold, make others good and
bold, and come to the yajamana with all the wealth and
honour. Going forward in harmony with the earth and
heaven, shining bright and virtuous as by the light of
the sun, drive out the dark, attain peace of mind, and be
the haven and life-support of the creative and purifying
energy of humanity.

14. (Vishvedeva Devata, Vatsara Kashyapa Rshi)

अर्छिन्नस्य ते aa सोम सुवीर्यस्य रायस्पोर्षस्य ददितार:
स्याम iat daar सँस्कृतिर्विश्वर्वारा स daar वरूंणो

Seeker of yoga, cool and excellent, bright and
brave, we are the generous source, givers of continuous
undisturbed stream of the wealth of life and yoga to
you. May that first original and universal culture of life
bless you. May the teacher, bright as Agni, deep as the
ocean, and benevolent as the sun be your foremost
friend.
