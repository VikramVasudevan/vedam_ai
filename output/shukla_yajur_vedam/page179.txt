Ruler and Head of the republic, lord of power
and wealth, this land and its governance is your haven,
the very meaning of your existence.

The enlightened ruler and the people, both
dynamic and intelligent, working at the speed of the
mind, sharp as an arrow and strong as adamant, think
hard and plan for the nation. In the light of his glory
shining in all directions and under the protection of the
fighters of this man of a mighty host working at his
command, they shine in peace and burn in war.

Protect and serve the people. Free of the enemies
as you are, may the divine powers who protect the brave
help and lead you on. Be invincible.
