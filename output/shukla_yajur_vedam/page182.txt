Soma flows. Soma flows and is purified. Soma
is purified and is offered for sacrifice. So does the ruler
flow, issues in action, and, through action, is purified,
sanctified, self-sacrificed.

The ruler is sanctified and dedicated to the
Brahamana sub-system (learning, education and
research), to the Kshatra sub-system (defence and
governance), to the devoted yajamana, participant in
the creative activities of the system, for food and energy,
for waters, herbs and vegetation, for earth and heaven,
for good life and conduct, for all the noble people of
the land.

Ruler of the nation, this life, this land, this socio-
political system is your haven and your justification.
You are accepted, sanctified and honoured for all the
noble people.
