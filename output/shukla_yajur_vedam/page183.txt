150 YAJURVEDA
22. (Vishvedeva Devata, Vatsara Kashyapa Rshi)

गृह्णामि। यत्त्तऽइन्द्र बृहद्वयस्तस्मै त्वा fasta त्वैष a योर्नि-
रुक्थेर्थ्यस्त्वा देवेर्भयस्त्वा देवाव्यं यज्ञस्यार्युषे गृह्णामि ॥२२॥

rukthebhyastva devebhyastva devavyam yajna-

Indra, meritorious man of arms, self-controlled
and established in the rules of law, good conduct and
service of the nation, I appoint you as commander of
the army in the service of Indra, lord of the land —
great is he, long-lived he be! Great is your work, a life-
time undertaking. For that you are appointed. For
Vishnu, lord supreme, for yajana, for the nation you are
consecrated. For the lord’s songs of praise, to the noble
people, to the health and continuance of the social yajna
of the land, to the defence and advancement of the noble
powers, you are dedicated. This is now your haven, your
very being, the meaning and justification of your
existence.
