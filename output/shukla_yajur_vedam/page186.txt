CHAPTER-VII 153

Lord of power and glory, Soma, Lord Creator and giver
of peace and joy, you can be reached through the
discipline of ‘yamas’ and ‘niyamas’, rules of social and
personal ethics ranging from love and non-violence to
total surrender to you. You are firm, inviolable base of
the stability of the stars and planets, firmest of the firm,
most imperishable of the imperishables (i.e., above the
original prakrti and the souls). This universe and the
laws of existence are pervaded by you — they are like
your universal home. Life and light of the world, Lord
of peace and joy, firm and eternal, to you, with a mind
of inviolable faith, in words of sincerity, we surrender
in obedience and homage. Lord of power and glory, let
our people be free of all enemies, let our nation be of
one and equal mind.

Host and master of yajna, whatever part of yajna
offerings goes over the earth and to the sky with the
wind, and whatever part gone up from the sacred lap of
the earth and the womb of space is released from the
clouds, and whatever part goes up from the hota and
the adhvaryu (the priests) and proclaims the virtues of
the performance, all that, in words of truth, with sincerity
of mind and honest conviction, I say, comes to bless
