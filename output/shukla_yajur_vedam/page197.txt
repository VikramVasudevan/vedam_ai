164 YAJURVEDA

who sends up his songs of praise natural as a child’s—
with light and lustre. In the light of that glory, we grow
in body, mind and soul.

Lord of us all, you can be reached only through
the discipline of yoga. You reside in the light of your
glory revealed in the heart. We worship you for the
realization of that glory, for the attainment of that infinite
love and compassion.

41. (Surya Devata, Praskanva Rshi)
दुशे favata सूर्यश्स्वाहां ॥४१॥

Udu tyam jatavedasam devam vahanti ketavah.
DrSe visvaya suryam svaha.

Just as the rays of the sun carry the light of the
sun to the world to reveal the glory of the sun for all to
see and realise, so do the manifestation of the Supreme
Light and Spirit reveal the glory of the Lord for all to
see and realise the presence of the power and the spirit.

So also do the words of the Rishi reveal the truth
of existence and the glory of the creator to help us realise
the presence of the Lord of Creation.
