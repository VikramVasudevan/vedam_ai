CHAPTER-VII 165

There arises the sun, wonderful splendour of the
gods, the light and eye of Mitra, Varuna and Agni, filling
the earth, the sky and the heaven with its glory, and
soul of the world moving and unmoving. This is the
divine voice. This is the oblation for him.

So is the Lord Creator and Supreme Spirit of the
universe, the light of lights, life of life and the real power
of the gods. That alone is the object of worship.

43. (Antaryami jagadeeshwara Devata, Angirasa Rshi)
अग्ने नर्य Guat रायेऽअस्मान्विश्वानि देव वयुर्नानि विद्वान्।

युयोध्युस्मर्जजुहुराणमेनो whet a नर्मंऽउक्तिं fae
स्वाहां॥४३॥

Agne naya supatha raye’ asman visvani deva
vayunani vidvan. Yuyodhyasmajjuhuranameno
bhuyistham te nama uktim vidhema svaha.

Agni, Lord of light and knowledge, you know
all the paths of the world into the treasures of wealth,
(the science of yoga also). Take us, lead us on by the
right path to the wealth of life, and remove from our
heart all the sin and evil. We sing in praise of divine
glory in all humility from the core of our heart. Bless us
with success in Dharma, artha, kama and moksha
through yoga and the divine voice, the Veda.

44. (Prajapati Devata, Angirasa Rshi)
अयं नोंऽअग्निर्वरिंवस्कृणोत्वयं qe: ars प्रभिन्दन् |

स्वाहा॥४४॥॥

Ayam no’agnirvarivaskrnotvayam mrdhah pura’

etu. prabhindan. Ayam  vajanjayatu
vajasatavayaim Satrunjayatu jarhrsanah svaha.
