168 YAJURVEDA

May Varuna, man of knowledge and
discrimination, assign me to a teacher of Vasu’s standing
of 24 years so that I become a Vasu brahmachari
(graduate) of agni’s brilliance and have the joy of
scientific truth and reality. May health and longevity
come to the giver, the teacher. May comfort and
prosperity come to the receiver, the disciple.

May Varuna, man of knowledge and
discrimination, assign me to a teacher of Rudra’s
standing of 44 years so that I become a Rudra
brahmachari (graduate) of Rudra’s justice and power
and have the joy of eternal knowledge of the world and
heaven. May the strength of pranic vitality come to the
giver, the teacher, and a life-time of health and
prosperity to the receiver, the disciple.

May Varuna assign me to a teacher of the Aditya
order of 48 years standing so that I become an Aditya
graduate of Brihaspati’s knowledge of the Vedas and
have the bliss of eternal vision of life. May the sensitivity
of tactual and all other senses come to the giver, and
the eternal joy of life and vision come to the receiver,
to me.

May Varuna assign me to a preceptor who has,
through yoga practice, transcended the ups and downs
of worldly existence so that I realise in practice the
pleasures of home-life and their value against a
comprehensive picture of life and death and attain,
through living, the eternal ananda of Moksha. May
divine realisation come to the giver, the preceptor, and
the joy of life and ultimate bliss of eternity come to the
receiver, to me.
