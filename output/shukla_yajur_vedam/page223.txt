190 YAJURVEDA

provide this food for you.

I eat my share of the food after those two. Both
of you, the people and the government, with the sacred
voice of the Veda which reveals the secrets of living
together in love and cooperation, be happy and
prosperous with full vigour.

Agni/Ruler, lord of knowledge and power, you
are noble with noble actions, first among all of noble
achievement. Purify us, and bless us with lustre, noble
vitality and prowess, wealth and good health with
nourishments of body and mind.

Noble ruler, accepted you are and consecrated in
the laws and constitution of the nation for the honour
and brilliance of the people and the land. This honour
and prestige, the nation, is now your haven, the reason
and justification of your being. We dedicate you to the
achievement of honour and glory.

Agni, lord of light and brilliance of action, you
are lustrous and honourable among the brilliant and the
generous rulers. I pray I be brilliant and honourable
among the people.
