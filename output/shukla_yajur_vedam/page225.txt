192 YAJURVEDA

Adrsramasya ketavo vi rasmayo janan’ anu.
Bhrajanto agnayo yatha. Upayamagrhito’ si
suryaya tva bhrajayaisa te yonih suryaya tva
bhrajaya. Surya bhrajistha bhrajisthastvam
devesvasi ‘bhrajistho’>ham manusyesu bhuya-
sam.

Just as the bright rays of light (fire, sun, and
electricity) shine on things to show them to the world,
similarly, I pray, I may see the people and other things
in the divine light of the Lord.

Accepted and sanctified you are in the rules and
laws of the land to shine in the business of the nation
like the sun. This is now your haven and home. You are
dedicated to the Sun, Lord Supreme of the universe, to
shine in life.

Ruler of the land, bright and sunny in knowledge
and justice, you are the brightest among the brilliant. I
pray I may shine the brightest among the people.

41. (Surya Devata, Praskanva Rshi)
उदु त्यं जातवेंदसं देवं र्वहन्ति cad: 1 get favata
सूर्यम् । उपयामगृहीतोऽसि gala त्वा भ्राजायैष ते योनि:
Gata त्वा भ्राजार्यं ॥४१॥

Udu tyam jatavedasam devam vahanti ketvah.
Drse visvaya suryam. Upayamagrhito’si suryaya
tva bhrajayaisa te yonih suryaya tva bhrajaya.

Just as the rays of the sun carry the light of the
sun for the world to see the sun, surely so the lights of
creation and the eyes of the seers reveal the light of the
Lord Creator, refulgent and omniscient of all that is born,
for the world to see.
