196 YAJURVEDA

Vishvakarma, lord of all actions and dharmas,
with vitalizing materials of yajna, strengthen the ruler
and make him an invincible protector of the people.
Let him grow mighty with ample means and materials.
To him, the people, as taught by the forefathers, bow in
homage.

Ruler, president of the council, accepted you are
by the people, and consecrated in the laws of the land
for service to the lord of action, Vishwakarma, and
honour of the nation (Indra). This service and this
honour now is your haven and home. You are dedicated
to the lord of action and dharma and the honour and
glory of the nation.
