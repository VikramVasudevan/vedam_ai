You two, commander and personnel of the forces,
front-line fighters, attacking as lighting and defending
as rock, whosoever attack us with his army, destroy him
with the thunderbolt. And if the enemy force happen to
contact us, arise with force and drive them off. Valiant
hero, all round destroyer of the enemy, eliminate our
enemies totally from the face of the earth. On the earth,
in the sky, in heaven, anywhere, let us be strong in
manpower with brave people, heroic with noble heroes
rich in food, energy and materials, with plenty of good
food, energy and materials. (Let us be well-provided:
justify our existence, defend our self-awareness and
culture, and work for universal happiness.)
