Learned, wise and generous people of the world,
those who raised the libations in the ladles for the fire
and sent up the fragrance to the clouds, who dedicated
and raised their mind’s energy for sacrifice and service,
who respected and served life as sacred, who spoke in
praise of the divine omnipresence of the all-seeing eye
of the Lord of existence, who enjoyed the soothing touch
of the air around and received the food sanctified by
yajna, they are the noble and brilliant ‘devas’, learned
and parental seniors, and reverential friends of humanity.
