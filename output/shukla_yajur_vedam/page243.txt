Men and women of the land, who have collected
strength and energy from yajna-ahutis and knowledge
from the Vedas, communicate with the intelligent and
the inspired people and share with them the common
wisdom. For you and the dear members of their
community, I have procured ample food and energy.

With means and materials for the nation, you are
accepted and consecrated in the laws and values of the
nation for the honour and prosperity of the people.
Loved of the people and favourite of the Lord as you
are, I accept and elect you. This nation and this choice
now is your haven and home. Most loved and honoured,
you are now totally committed and dedicated to Indra,
lord of the people, the land and the world.

Ruler and the people, remain united for good
work. Join me to goodness and prosperity. Stay away
from evil, both of you. Keep us away from the evil-
minded.
