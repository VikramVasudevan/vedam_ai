216 YAJURVEDA

Men bright as sunbeams, this national language
of yours should be true, good, common and one by
which Brihaspati, ruler of the great land and leader of
education and enlightenment may win the battle of unity
and education. Men of plenty and abundance, cooperate
and help Brihaspati win the battle and free the nation
from ignorance, disunity and suffering.

Men bright as sunbeams, the language of yours
should be true, good, common and one by which Indra,

and free the nation from ignorance and suffering.

In the world, the cosmic yajna of Savita, Lord of
light and life, the great lord creator and promoter of
truth, Brihaspati, victor of wars I wish and pray I may
win the battles of life.

Great warriors, winners of battles, stem the routes
of the enemy’s advance, and, crossing leagues of virgin
territory, spread over the directions.
