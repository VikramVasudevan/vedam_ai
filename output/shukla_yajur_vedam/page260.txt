CHAPTER-IX 227

won and sustains the five directions (east, west, north,
south and up and down), so should I win and support
them. (The ruler should maintain and sustain nature in
all directions and so should the people support the ruler
and preserve nature).

Savita, the sun, with six-syllable Trishtup verse,
generates and lights the six seasons, so should I light
and enrich them. (The ruler should keep the seasons of
nature clean and unpolluted, and so should the people.)

The Maruts, winds, with seven-syllable Jagati
verse sustain and support seven domestic animals. So
should I protect and promote them. (The ruler should
protect and promote the domestic animals, and the
people should support the ruler and promote animal life.)

Brihaspati, lord of the divine voice and knowledge,
with eight-syllable yajushi anushtup verse conquered
gayatri. So should I too master and serve that. (The ruler
of the people should honour and preserve value-based
policy of governance and administration and the people
should support the ruler and maintain the policies of value
and the values of right policies.)
