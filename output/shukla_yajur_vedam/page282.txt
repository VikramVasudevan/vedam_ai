CHAPTER-X 249

(8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, 12 Adityas, Indra, i.e., electric
energy, and yajna, i.e., cosmic chemistry) would reveal
to you; the lustre of knowledge and discipline and the
wealth of life would bless you. The heads of the sinner,
the thief and the preventer would be down.

15. (Paramatma Devata, Varuna Rshi)

सोर्मस्य त्विर्षिरसि ada a त्विरषिर्भूयात् ।
Went: पाह्योर्जोऽसि सर्होऽस्यमृतमसि ।।१७५॥

Somasya tvisirasi taveva me tvisirbhuydt.
Mrtyoh pahyojo’si saho’syamrtamasi.

You are the light of majesty and magnificence. May
your light be mine too. You are the lustre of life, the
constancy of courage, and the immortality of existence.
Save me from mortality.

16. (Mitra-Varuna Devate, Varuna Rshi)

fatvaraussrat विरोकऽउभारविन्द्राऽउर्दिथ: Gave |
मित्रोऽसि वरुंणोऽसि ॥१६॥

Hiranyarupa’ usaso viroka’ ubhavindra’

varuno ’S1.

You are Mitra, friend of all. You are Varuna, the
best of all and subduer of the enemies. Both of you are
bright and powerful like gold, like the sun, like Indra.
And just as the sun and the moon with their light light
up the night and the dawn, so you too, with your
illuminating actions, rise and enlighten the world around
you. Ascend your chariot of knowledge, watch the world
