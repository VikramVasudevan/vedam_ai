promote for agni, the enlightened householder, a true
policy of value and virtue; for soma, herbs and trees,
forestry and knowledge of Botany; for the strength,
energy and lustre of the most dynamic people (maruts),
yoga and peace-giving words; for the honour of Indra,
ruler, right conduct and good reading; for the working
efficiency of the soul (Indra), good instruction and
practice. Mother earth, hurt me not. Nor shall I hurt
you. Mother mine, ruin me not with wrong instruction.
Nor must I hurt you (with ingratitude).
