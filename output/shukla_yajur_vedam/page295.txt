262 YAJURVEDA

Yuktvaya savita devantsvaryato dhiya divam.
Brhajjyotih karisyatah savita prasuvati tan.

The yogis, noble people, trying to reach the
regions of light and heavenly bliss with their mind and
sense, refine their faculties as instruments of divination
into the light and mystery of infinity. Savita, Lord of
light and generator of life, inspires their mind and soul
and helps them to join with the object of their love and
ambition.

4. (Savita Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

युञ्जते wissa dea धियो fem fater get
विंपश्चिर्त: । fa dat दधे वयुनाविदेकऽइन्मही tact
सवितु: परिष्टुति: isi

Yunjate mana’uta yunjate dhiyo vipra viprasya
brhato vipascitah. Vi hotra dadhe vayunavideka’
inmahi devasya savituh paristutih.

Great is the glory and high the praise of Savita,
generous creator of light and life, the one mighty,
infinite, all seeing, all-knowing lord of the universe.
He alone receives all our prayers and sacrifices. Thereon
do yogis, men of wisdom and vision, concentrate their
mind and intelligence — only there and nowhere else.
