CHAPTER -XI 263

I join, and join you both, with the eternal lord of
the universe with hymns of praise and prayer as did the
yogis of old. May our song of prayer reach its divine
destination by the sure path of the great and the wise
seers. Listen all ye children of Immortality who inhabit
the holy worlds of the Lord’s creation and join to reach
the goal.
