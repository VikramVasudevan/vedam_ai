Imam no deva savitar yajnam pranaya devavyam

Savita, lord of life and inspiration, light, promote
and expand this yajna of ours which protects our noble
people and the virtues of our character, favours our
friends, wins our yajnic sessions of truth and gives us
wealth and happiness. Let it prosper with the chants of
Rgvedic hymns and advance into the wealth of Dharma
and knowledge with the truth of word and honesty of
action. Let it rise with the gayatri verses revealing the
paths of progress and prosperity to be covered and won
through the scientific gifts of rathantara, modes of speed
and progress.
