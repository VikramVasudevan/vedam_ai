Man of knowledge and vision, I accept and
welcome you as a man initiated by fire in this world of
Savita’s creation alongwith the force and attraction of
the energy of prana and the attraction and retention of
the life-giving air.

Take up the study of agni (heat and electricity)
immanent in the earth and revealed in the gayatri verses,
and discover and develop for us its energy value like
that of prana, the breath of life. Discover the energy-
potential of the waters revealed in the trishtubh verses,
and develop it like the blazing ambers of fire.

Man of scholarship and imagination, you are a
tool of discovery and development of yajnic value for
humanity. Living together with you, let us be able to
discover the secrets and then develop the power of agni
(fire and electricity) with the help of the jagati verses
of the Veda — agni which is like the very breath of life.
