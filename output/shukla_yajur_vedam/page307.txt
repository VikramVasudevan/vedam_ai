274 YAJURVEDA

and develop the power of agni, electricity from the midst
of the sky, since it is present universally like the breath
of air — agni which is a source of light, bright and
beautiful, blazing by the splendour of the eternal sun,
injuring none, and a means of comfort and happiness
for all the people.

29. (Agni Devata, Gritsamada Rshi)

वर्धमानो महाँ२।ऽआ a askt feat acta afte
WaT ॥२९॥

Apam prsthamasi yoniragneh samudramabhitah
pinvamanam. Vardhamano mahan’a ca puskare
divo matraya varimna prathasva.

Agni, universal electric energy, you are the carrier
of the waters and the mother of fire. Expanding the
oceans (on earth and in the sky), yourself expanding on
all sides, go on expanding with the expansive space of
the heavens in the great womb of eternity.

30. (Dampati Devate, Gritsamada Rshi)

शर्म च स्थो वर्म` च स्थोऽच्छिद्रे बहुलेऽउभे |
व्यर्चस्वती संवंसाथां भृतमग्निं dither ॥३०॥

Sarma ca stho varma ca stho’chidre bahule’
ubhe. Vyacasvati samvasatham bhrtamagnim
purisyam.

Man and wife, both of you live together in a
comfortable home of peace and plenty, safety and
security, in a state of abundance and uninterrupted
happiness. Live together a long age with yajna which,
well-maintained, is the best guardian-source of conjugal
bliss.
