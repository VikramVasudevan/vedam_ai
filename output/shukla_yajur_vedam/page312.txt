Agni, worthy house-holder of yajnic work and
conduct of love and non-violence, arise, and, with noble
and virtuous intelligence, advance and protect us.
Brilliant as fire and the sun, go forward with great
splendour and fame, doing laudable work for all to see.

intelligence, brilliant as the sun, stay firm for our
protection and progress. Eminent scholar of science and
technology as you are, you procure for us means of
power and defence. We call upon you and honour you
with the scholars of distinction and penetrative vision
sharp as the beams of sunlight.
