284 YAJURVEDA

Tasma’aram gamama vo yasya ksayaya
jinvatha. Apo janayatha ca nah.

Women, cool, pure and generous like holy waters,
be active and happy and create conjugal peace and joy
for a happy home for us and yourselves. And we too
shall be wholly and exclusively with you with all our
heart and soul.

53. (Mitra Devata, Sindhudveepa Rshi)
सुर्जातं जातवेंदसमयक्ष्मार्यं त्वा asda worst: 130

Mitrah samsrjya prthivim bhumim ca jyotisa
saha. Sujatam jatavedasamayaksmaya tva sain
srjami prajabhyah.

Just as Mitra, the sun, joining the earth and the
sky, illumines the two with its light, similarly I join you,
Agni (yajna fire), brilliant and beautiful, and light you
for the health and well-being of the people.

Just as you, husband and dear friend, having
joined the earth and home with the light of your
knowledge and sense of justice, give me love and joy
for the health and happiness of the family and the people,
so do I join and help you, man of noble birth and
education, in the life of the home and the people.
