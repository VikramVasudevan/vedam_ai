CHAPTER -XI 295

With truth of word and honesty of commitment,
maintain the fire which inspires you to proclaim the
truth in speech and to safeguard it in memory and
tradition.

Keep up the fire of inspiration, action and
enthusiasm for the preservation and promotion of agni
(fire and energy, both physical and mental), lighted, used
and applied in personal yoga and collective action in
the service of Prajapati, lord of the created world, Manu,
men of thought, research and meditation, Agni, the
enlightened leaders of the world, and Vaishwanara, the
omnipresent Life of existence — the Supreme.

(Keep up the fire, for the fire, in the service of
Fire, Agni).

67. (Savita Devata, Atreya Rshi)

fasat देवस्यं नेतुर्मर्तो` atta सख्यम् |
favat रायऽईषुध्यति द्युम्नं duita Gera caret ॥६७॥

Visvo devasya neturmarto vurita sakhyam. Visvo

raya ’isudhyati dyumnam vrnita pusyase svaha.

Let the people of the world opt for the love and

friendship of the leading Light of the world. Let them

all gird up their loins, take up arms for the wealth of the

world and win the prize of honour and prosperity with
truth of word and deed. This is how you flourish.
