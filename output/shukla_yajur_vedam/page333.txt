Ruler of the land, Chief of law and order, tear
the night-walkers and highway men with the fangs of
punishment, crush the robbers and smugglers with the
jaws of justice. Seize and hold the thieves and grabbers
of others’ rights and property with the chains of law.
You eliminate them all.

Chief of law and order, those who commit
despicable acts in the public, rob and smuggle in the
forests, and commit crimes in high and hiding places
and live a life of sin and crime, all these I put into the
court of your justice.

Ruler of the land, if a person maligns us out of
hostility, or hates us out of jealousy, or speaks ill of us
out of contempt, or deceives us to injure and destroy
us, reduce all that hate, anger and negativity to ashes.
