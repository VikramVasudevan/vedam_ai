302 YAJURVEDA

Annapate ’nnasya no dehyanamivasya susminah.
Pra pra dataram tarisa’ urjam no dhehi dvipade
catuspade.

Lord of food and energy, bless us with food,
nourishing, invigorating, free from pollution and
pleasing to taste. Bless the giver, the yajamana, to
advance and attain fulfilment and prosperity. Give us
energy both for humans and the animals.
