CHAPTER-XII 307

Akrandadagni stanayanniva dyauh ksama
rerihad virudhah samanjan. Sadyo jajnano vi
himiddho’ akhyada rodasi bhanuna bhatyantah.

Agni roars like thunder in the sky and proclaims
itself. Colourfully vitalizing the trees it caresses and
blesses the earth with beauty and fruit. Properly lighted,
it shines bright and immediately makes itself known.
Between the earth and the heavens it blazes with its
own splendour like the sun.

(Just as agni is radiant and benevolent with its
own majesty, so should the ruler/President of the
republic be brilliant with his own qualities of nature,
character and actions and bless the people with his grace
and benevolence. Only a person of benevolence and
brilliance deserves to be the ruler.)

7. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)

अग्नेऽभ्यावर्तिन्नभि मा निर्वर्त्तस्वार्युषा वर्च्चसा प्रजया
aaa | सन्या मेधयां रय्या पोर्षेण ॥७॥

Agne’bhyavarttinnabhi ma nivarttasvayusa
varcasa prajaya dhanena. Sanya medhaya rayya
posena.

Agni, brilliant and blazing presence abiding
before us, generous man of knowledge, come blessing
us with health and longevity, lustre of life, children and
family, wealth and prosperity, acquisition and
fulfilment, discriminative intelligence, beauty and
dignity of life, and all-round growth and progress.
