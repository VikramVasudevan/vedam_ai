Saha rayya nivarttasvagne pinvasva dharya.

Agni, brilliant power/Enlightened sages, come
with all the wealth, come with gifts of that language
and that intelligence which holds for us all the means
and materials of comfort and prosperity. Come, and help
us grow in all directions of life.

आ त्वाहार्षमन्तरभूर्धुवस्तिष्ठाविचाचत्नि: |
विरशस्त्वा सर्वी वाञ्छन्तु मा त्वद्राष्ट्मर्धिभ्रशत् ॥११॥

Visastva sarva vanchantu ma tvadrastram-
adhibhrasat.

Agni/Ruler of the land, we accept you and
conduct you to the council as the ruler. Grace the seat
of your office, be firm and stay inviolable. All the people
accept and honour you. Let the land and the nation,
under your control, never fail and fall to ruin.

Varuna, lord of freedom and bondage, Ruler of
the land, power of law and liberty, loosen and untie our
chains of bondage of the highest, medium and the lowest
order and let them drop from us. And then O Sun, lord
of majesty, we shall be free from evil, crime and sin
