integrity.

13. (Agni Devata, Trita Rshi)

अग्रे qeqraileaisshankastranry तर्मसो ज्योतिषार्गात्।
अग्निर्भानुना esta स्वङ्गऽआजातो विश्वा carer: 11g 3

Agre brhannusasamurdhvo’ asthannirjaganvan

Agni, the sun, great, first and foremost, positioned
over and above the dawn, comes forth from the dark
and rises with all its glory. Resplendent with its
wonderful beams which adorn it like brilliant limbs of
its personality, it expands over the regions of the world,
dispels the darkness and illuminates them all over with
its light. (So should the ruler, first and great among the
brilliant people of the land, come forth with the greatness
of his personality, illuminate the land and glorify all
the people.)
