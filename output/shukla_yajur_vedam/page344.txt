of oblations in yajna. It sits in the vedi and in the earth.
It is rambling around as a venerable visitor. It stays in
the home and in the sky and all through the seasons. It
rules over people and commands the commanders. It is
with and above the best of people. It lives in truth and
in virtuous conduct. It is in space and in the heart. It is
in the waters and in the vitality of prana, and it creates
the waters and the vitality. It activates the senses, moves
the animals and magnetizes the earth. It creates the
universal law and abides in it. It forms the mountains
and the clouds and it showers with the rain. It is the
truth and dynamic reality of existence, and it is great
over all.

(It is the man of such an individual soul, inspired
by the attributes of the great supreme soul, who deserves
to be the ruler.)

Agni/Ruler/individual soul, you know all the
ways of the world. Sit in the lap of this mother earth/
mother-land/mother. Don’t hurt her with the heat of your
power and passion. Don’t dazzle her with the beams of
your knowledge. Light of knowledge and power of
vitality, be in the heart of the mother and shine there
with the light of life.
