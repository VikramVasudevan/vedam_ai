20. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)
समुद्रे wat नृमरणांऽअप्स्वुन्तर्नृच्चक्षांऽईधे feat atmas-

ऊर्धन् ॥ gett त्वा रर्जसि afterares trary

Samudre tva nrmana’apsvantarnrcaksa’idhe
divo agna’udhan. Trtiye tva rajasi tasthivam-
samapamupasthe mahisa’ avardhan.

Agni, light and life of the world, a leader of
thought among men, as I am, I discover and light you in
the oceans. A visionary of humanity, I discover you in
the foods, in the vapours and in the clouds. In the third
region of the heavens of light, abiding in the solar
sphere, in the dawn and in the heart of steam and flowing
waters, great men discover, light and develop you.

21. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)
अरक्रन्ददग्नि स्तनर्यन्निव dt: amt thea died:
समञ्जन् | सद्यो Gari fa हीमिद्धोऽअख्यदा रोर्दसी
Wal भात्यन्त: ॥२१॥

Akrandadagni stanayanniva dyauh ksama
rerihad virudhah samanjan. Sadyo jajnano vi
himiddho’ akhyada rodasi bhanuna bhatyantah.

Agni, light and energy of life, roaring as lightning,
reverberates in the skies with an explosion. Lighted well
all-round and immediately blazing, it shines and
illuminates everything. Between the heaven and the
earth it shines with the beams of its own brilliance. The
light reaches the earth, energizes the soil and emerges
in the beauty of vegetation.
