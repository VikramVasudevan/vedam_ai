320 YAJURVEDA

not our people and our children.

(As Agni, so should the ruler and the commander
of the army be mighty and blazing with splendour,
always protective but never unjust and hurtful.)

33. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)

steraaha स्तनर्यन्निव et: क्षामा रेरिंहद् वीरुर्ध: समजञ्जन्।
सद्यो wart fa हीमिद्धोऽअख्यदा रोर्दसी art

भात्यन्त: URI

Akrandadagni stanayanniva dyauh ksama
rerihadvirudhah samanjan. Sadyo jajnano vi
himiddho akhyada rodasit bhanuna bhatyanth.

Agni roars and thunders like lightning in the sky
as it proclaims its presence on the earth. Joining every
bit of life and vegetation, it inspires all forms of
existence with passion and vitality and thus manifests
itself, protecting and promoting life. And it goes on
blazing with its mighty splendour from the earth below
to the highest heaven.

(So does the scholar with his knowledge, the ruler
with his power, and the commander with his force, shine
and blaze all round, protecting, promoting and inspiring
the nation and the environment with freedom, passion
and enthusiasm).

34. (Agni Devata, Vasishtha Rshi)

प्रप्रायमग्निर्भरतरस्य sua fa aga न wee बृहद्भा:
अभि a: ge पूर्तनासु तस्थौ दीदाय दैव्मोऽअ'त्तिंश्रि
frat 4: ॥३४॥

Pra prayamagnirbharatasya srnve vi yatsuryo

na rocate brhadbhah. Abhi yah purum prtanasu
tasthau didaya daivyo’ atithih Sivo nah.
