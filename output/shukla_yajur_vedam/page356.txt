CHAPTER-XII 323

Punarasadya sadanamapasca prthivimagne.
Sese maturyathopasthe ’ntarasyam sivatamah.

Agni, soul with the desire and will to live in the
forms of existence, again and again you come to find a
place in the celestial waters of space. Again and again
you descend to the earth to attain herbal forms of life.
Then again you enter the mother’s womb and rest there
to grow as a part of her life within. When you are born,
you sleep in her lap in peace and joy. Noble soul, be
good to the mother, be the darling of her love, joy and
fulfilment.

40. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)

पुर्नरूर्जा निवर्त्तस्व पुर्नरग्नऽइषार्युषा ।
पुर्नर्न: पाह्यश्हस: ॥४०॥

Punarurja nivarttasva punaragna’isa”’yusa.
Punarnah pahyamhasah.

Agni, come again with energy, come with food,

come with health and vitality for a long age. Come again
and again, save us from sin and evil.

41. (Agni Devata, Vatsapree Rshi)
We var निर्वर्त्तस्वाग्ने freee amar |
fasaceat विश्वतस्परिं ॥४१॥

Saha rayya nivarttasvagne pinvasva dharaya.
Visvapsnya visvataspari.

Agni, come with wealth and honour. Come with
a shower of all round nourishment and universal energy
to the point of satisfaction and satiation for all and help
us grow, develop and progress. Come with food for body
and mind.
