326 YAJURVEDA

46. (Agni Devata, Somahuti Rshi)
संज्ञार्नमसि caraetot uf a कामधरंणं yar |
श्रयध्वम् USE I

Samjnanamasi kamadharanam mayi te
kamadharanam bhuyat. Agnerbhasmasyagneh.
purisamasi cita stha paricita’ urdhvacitah
Srayadhvam.

Agni, man of knowledge, having passed through
the crucibles of fire like ash, you are knowledge itself,
full and complete like the orb of the sun and powerful
like the force of electricity. May your plans, intentions
and aspirations pass on to me as mine.

Be wide-awake, collect knowledge from all round,
go forward and take it to the heights. Be cooperative,
mutually dependent, collectively self-dependent. Take to
knowledge and to the teachers.

47. (Agni Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

अयश्सोऽअग्निर्यस्मिन्त्सोममिन्द्र: Ye दधे st ara
शान:। सहस्रियं वाजमत्यं न सप्तिंश्ससवान्त्सन्त्स्तूयसे
जातवेद: ॥४७॥

Ayam so’agniryasmintsomamindrah sutam
dadhe jathare vavasanah. Sahasriyam
vajamatyam na saptim sasavantsantstuyase
jatavedah.

This is that agni, vital heat of life, in which Indra,
the sun, as if in love with life, places the nectar of life,
Soma, like the distilled and delicious food for a thousand
people. Life of life, Jataveda, generous giver as you are,
you are worshipped by the devotees in your own right.
