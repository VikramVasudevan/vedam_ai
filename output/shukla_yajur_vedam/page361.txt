328 YAJURVEDA

Agni, man of knowledge and light of the world,
your knowledge reaches unto the waters of heaven and
you proclaim that knowledge to the bold and the best
among intelligent people who impart it to their disciples.
It covers the waters which float in the luminous sphere
of the sun and studies the vapours and energy vibrant on
this side of the sun and beyond.
