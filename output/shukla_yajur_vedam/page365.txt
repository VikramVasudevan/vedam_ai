332 YAJURVEDA

Wedded couple, I join you as two-in-one in life
and sanctify you with identical thoughts, intentions and
operations, identical vows of plans, actions and
achievements, and identical memories, values and
aspirations.

Agni, noble teacher, high-priest of yajna, be our
super-guide and guardian. Create, hold and sustain for
the yajamana couple nourishment, energy, honour and
prosperity.

Agni, Lord of knowledge, light and power of
yajna, rich in spirit, science and materials, and presiding

and the laws of life. Rise, move abroad and, having
created peace and prosperity in all directions, come and
grace your super-seat of guidance.
