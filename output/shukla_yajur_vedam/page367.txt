thief and the smuggler and catch him on the way. Go to
someone other than me. That is your desired object and
action. Salutations to you, power of justice.

63. (Nirriti Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)

7a: सु a निर्ऋते तिग्मतेजोऽयस्मयं fader aera ।
यमेन त्वं यम्या सविदानोत्तमे नाकेऽअर्धिरोहयैनम् ॥६३॥

Namah su te nirrte tigmatejo’yasmayam vicrta
bandhametam. Yamena tvam yamya samvidan-
ottame nake’adhi rohayainam.

Power of eternal law, eternal felicity and
adversity, your splendour is awful. You go with the law
and are one with the law. Salutations to you. Undo the
iron-chains of slavery and take this yajamana to the
heights of heavenly bliss.

64. (Nirriti Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)

यस्यांस्ते चोरऽआसञ्जुहोम्येषां बन्धार्नामवसर्जनाय | यां
त्वा जनो भूमिरिर्तिं प्रमन्दंते निर्ऋतिं त्वाहं uaa
विश्वर्त: ॥६४॥॥

Yasyaste ghora’asanjuhomyesam bandhana-
mavasarjanaya. Yam tva jano bhumiriti
pramandate nirrtim tva’ ham pariveda visvatah.

Awful spirit of adversity, eternal felicity, ever-
abiding with the law, I offer the oblations into your mouth/
in the yajna vedi for the breaking of the chains of
existence. Ordinary folks play with you in a state of
wanton negligence, feeling that you are the all forbearing
earth. But I know you well for what you are, spirit of
justice, as the mother of felicity as well as the power of
retribution.
