CHAPTER -XII 337

Sunam su phala vi krsantu bhumim sunam
kinasa’abhi yantu vahaih. Sunasira havisa
tosamana supippala osadhth kartanasmai.

Let the plough-shares turn the soil well. Let the
farmers merrily follow the bullocks while they till the
land and sow the seeds. May the sun and the air
supplemented by the oblations of rich materials bless the
herbs and plants with delicious fruit and nourishing
grain.

70. (Krishivala Devata, Kumaraharita Rshi)

gaa सीता मर्धुना सर्मज्यतां fagddartaat wets: |
ऊर्ज`स्वती cater fodamrearcta पर्यसाभ्यार्ब-
ARTA ॥७०॥

Ghrtena sita madhuna samajyatam visvair-
devairanumata Marudbhih. Urjasvati payasa
pinvamanasmantsite payasa’bhya vavrtsva.

Let the furrow in the field, made by the plough-
share and levelled and refined by the leveller, accepted
and approved by all the noble and generous people and
vitalized by winds and rain, be enriched with water, ghee,
sugar and honey. Energized and enriched thus with food,
the field may yield for us a wealth of delicious
nourishment.

71. (Krishivala Devata, Kumaraharita Rshi)

प्रफर्व्य च पीर्वरीं प्रस्थार्वद्रथवारहंनम् ॥७१॥

Langalam paviravat suSevam somapitsaru.
Tadudvapati gamavim prapharvyam ca pivarim
prasthavadrathavahanam.
