The year goes with the divisions of time, the dawn
is one with the ruddy morning, the pranic energies
express themselves in the actions of nature and of living
beings, the sun shines and radiates light with its rays,
the vital heat loves the earth, the libations of yajna and
the voice of the Veda.

(So should the people live together with one
another. So should the husband and wife live a common
shared life, complementing and supplementing each other
in an integrated life.)

75. (Vaidya Devata, Bhishak Rshi)

या sitet: dt जाता gesagt पुरा ।
at नु बभ्रूर्णामहश्शातं sat सप्त च ॥७५॥

Ya osadhih purva jata devebhyastriyugam pura.
Manai nu babhrinamaham satam dhamani
sapta ca.

Earlier, three years before in the three seasons,
whatever herbs such as soma etc. grew out of the earth
with other natural powers such as water, air and sunlight,
I should know: the hundred and seven varieties of these
brown ones for the treatment of hundred and seven
ailments which affect hundred and seven vital spots in
the body.
