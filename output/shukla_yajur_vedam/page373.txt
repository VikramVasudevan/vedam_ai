Mother earth, mother of herbs, hundreds are the
places where the herbs grow, and thousands are the roots
by which they grow into innumerable varieties. Then, O
physicians of a hundred specialities of ailments and
scholars of a hundred varieties of herbs, come you all
and render this body and community of mine free from
all disease.

All of you men and women, herbs, creepers and
plants such as soma, in full bloom, rich in fruit and
medicine, fast and victorious over disease take you across
all ailments and sorrow. Use them, be healthy and strong
and, like the victorious men of horse, rejoice and be
grateful to them.
