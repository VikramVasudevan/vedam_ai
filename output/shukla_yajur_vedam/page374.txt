CHAPTER -XII 341

Herbs and medicinal plants, as mothers, are of
divine efficacy. They nourish and save like mothers.
Hence I pray for you all: Lord of Life, Supreme Soul,
may I by divine grace have the gift of horses, cows,
clothes and home, and a healthy body.

79. (Waidyas Devata, Bhishak Rshi)
अश्वत्थे at निषर्दनं aut at वसतिष्क्वृता |
गोभाजऽइत् किर्लासथ यत् सनर्वथ पूरुंषम् Wee

Asvatthe vo nisadanam parne vo vasatiskrta.
Gobhaja’ itkilasatha yat sanavatha purusam.

Men and women of the earth, you reside in a body
which may or may not last till to morrow. Your life rests
like a drop of dew on the leaf. Take the gifts of the earth
and look after the soul in the body with herbs and
medicines to live a full life.

80. (Oshadhaya Devata, Bhishak Rshi)
यत्रौर्षधी: Gada रार्जान: सर्मिताविव |
fay: सऽर्डच्यते भिषर्ग्रक्षोहामींवचार्तन: ॥८०॥
Yatrausadhih samagmata rajanah samitaviva.
Viprah sa’ucyate bhisag raksohamivacatanah.

Wherever medicinal herbs such as soma grow,
there go as brave warriors go to the battlefield against
the enemy. That person of intelligence and expertise who
fights disease and destroys the anti-life forces is called
the physician, the person who cures.
