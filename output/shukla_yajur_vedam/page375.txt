342 YAJURVEDA

Asvavatin somavatimurjayantimudojasam. A
vitsi sarva’ osadhirasma ’aristatataye.

Medicinal herb is that which is powerfully
efficacious, nourishing and rejuvenating, strengthening
and lustrously invigorating. Physician, know and find all
such herbs for the health and immunity of the sick and
the needy.

82. (Oshadhaya Devata, Bhishak Rshi)

उच्छुष्माऽऒर्षधीनां गार्वो गोष्ठादिंवेरते |
at सनिष्यन्तींनामात्मानं at Ger eR

Ucchusma’osadhinam gavo gosthadiverate.
Dhanain sanisyantinamatmanam tava purusa.

O man, the invigorating power and fragrance of
vitality of the herbs which are ever keen to give health
and lustre to your body and soul issues forth from them
just as cows issue forth from the cow-shed (anxious to
feed their calves).

83. (Vaidyas Devata, Bhishak Rshi)

इष्कृतिर्नार्म at माताथो qaeseat Freket: |
सीरा: dafioit स्थन यदामर्यति Preheat ॥८३॥

I[skrtirnama vo mata’tho yuyain stha niskrtth.
Sirah patatrini sthana yadamayati niskrtha.

Know the medicine which, as mother, serves your
life with healing and, like the flowing streams, repay the
debt by completing the development of the science of
healing by herbs. Whatever causes disease and loss of
health, remove from the paths of life.
