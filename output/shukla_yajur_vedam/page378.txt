CHAPTER-XII 345

and those which are without fruit, those which are rich
in flowers and those which are without flowers, all of
them are created by the Lord Creator. Let all of them,
with proper treatment and preparation by the physician,
protect us and free us from disease and pain.

90. (Vaidyas Devata, Bhishak Rshi)

मुञ्चन्न्तु मा शपथ्याद्थो वरुण्सादुत |
stat यमस्य पड्वींशात्सर्वस्माद् देवकिल्विषात् ॥९०॥

Muncantu ma sapathyadatho varunyaduta. Atho
yamasya padvisat sarvasmad devakilvisat.

May the physicians and the medicines protect us
against ill-will, anathema and self-guilt. May they free
us from water-borne diseases and those which are
peculiar to the prosperous and the distinguished persons.
May they release us from ailments caused by acts of
indiscipline and breach of the rules of health and the good
life. May they save us from all diseases caused by neglect
or indulgence of the senses and the mind and those caused
by frustration of the intellectuals.

91. (Vaidyas Devata, Bhishak Rshi)
अवपर्तन्तीरवदन्दिवऽऒरषधयस्परिं ।
a जीवमश्नर्वामहै न a रिंष्याति पूरुंष: ॥९१॥
Avapatantiravadan diva’ osadhayaspari. Yam
jivamasnavamahai na sa risyati purusah.

The medicinal herbs come from heaven, the
region of light and life. So say the wise. The person
who feeds upon them never comes to any suffering.
