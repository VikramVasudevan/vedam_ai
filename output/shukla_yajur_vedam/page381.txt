O Gandharva, herbal medicine, the singer and
artist searches for and discovers you. So does Indra,
man of power and virility, Brihaspati, man of universal
Vaidic lore, Soma, man of peace and blessed virtue, the
ruler and the scholar. They all search for, discover, use
and benefit from herbal medicines and free themselves
from consumptive ailments.

Herbal medicine challenges disease. It resists the
anti-life forces and overthrows the enemies of good health
: Let the medicine resist all that causes sin and disease.
It resists, fights out, defeats and eliminates the negativities
and builds up the vitality and invincibility of the system
for longevity.
