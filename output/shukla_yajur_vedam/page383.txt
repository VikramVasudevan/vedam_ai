350 YAJURVEDA

Ma ma himsijjanita yah prthivya yo va divain
satyadharma vyanat. Yascapascandrah
prathamo jajana kasmai devaya havisa vidhema.

The Lord who is the creator of the earth, who is
the lord of the universal law of truth, who is the first of
all and creator of the air, waters and the moons, and
who pervades the heavens, whom we worship with the
best homage of fragrant oblations, that lord of life may
never hurt us with disease and ill-health.

103. (Agni Devata, Hiranyagarbha Rshi)

अभ्यार्वर्त्तस्व पृथिवि aga पर्यसा ae |
वपां dsattaR faatsahted ॥१०३॥

Abhyavartasva prthivi yajnena payasa saha.
Vapam te’agnirisito’arohat.

Come earth, revolving with yajna and water, milk
and food, again and again, continuously. And may agni,
vital life-generating heat of nature, activated by the Lord
creator of life, bless your fertility and increase your power
of production.

104. (Agni Devata, Hiranyagarbha Rshi)

तद्देवेभ्यों भरामसि ॥१०४॥

Agne yatte Sukram yaccandram yatputam yacca
yajniyam. Taddevebhyo bharamasi.

Agni, vital energy of the universe, may we imbibe
and internalize that power of your nature, character and
function which is immaculate and generative, beautiful
and blissful, pure and sacred, and worthy of service and
worship through yajna for growth and development.
