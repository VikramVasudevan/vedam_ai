CHAPTER -XIII 359

You are the original cause of heat and light. Surrounding
and feeding the expansive oceans on earth and in space
from all sides, you are great and ever greater in the
intervening spaces between earth and heaven. And you
reveal your glory by the measure and immensity of the
light of heaven.

Brahma jajnanam prathamam purastdad vi

asya visthah satasSca yonimasatasca vi vah.

Brahma, infinite spirit of the universe, all-creator
and omniscient, is the first and greatest reality of
existence. Worthy of love and adoration, It is the highest
object of desire for the wise. The great and glorious
objects (such as the sun, the moon, the earth) which fill
the skies in various regions of space are exemplary
revelations of Its creative power.

In the beginning of creation, that Brahma, from
the potential and law of Its own existence, invokes
Prakriti, the original Nature which is the cause of all
that is come into existence and also that which is yet to
come into existence.
