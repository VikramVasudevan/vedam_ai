knowledge and education, may our teachers like Indra
and Agni in-form and in-vest our deep interest in life
and nature with the hidden secrets of light, power and
sensation as expressions of one universal natural energy
(Prakriti).

विराड् ज्योर्तिरधारयत् स्वराड् ज्योर्तिरधारयत् ।॥
विश्वस्मै प्राणायांपानार्य व्यानाय विश्वं ज्योर्तिर्यच्छ् ।
अग्निष्टेऽर्धिपतिस्तयां देवर्तयाङ्निरस्वद् gat सींद ॥२४॥

The cosmic forms of the universe bear the light
of the Lord. Self-luminant stars such as the sun bear the
light as their own.

O lady of light and knowledge, noble teacher and
torch-bearer, may the father of created beings, Prajapati,
instal you in your seat on the face of the earth. Give full
light of knowledge to others for the sake of full energy,
safeguard against suffering, and all good qualities of
nature, character and action. Agni, lord of light and life,
is your master and guardian. Stay firm and secure with
that noble and gracious lord as the soul with the body,
Prakriti with Purusha and the light of dawn with the
day.
