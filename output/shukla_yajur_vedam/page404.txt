universe, nature and spring, as breath abides by life, as
Prakriti abides by Purusha, and as part abides by the
whole.

26. (Kshatrapati Devata, Savita Rshi)
अर्षाढासि सहंमाना सहस्वारांती: सर्हस्व पृतनायत: |
सहर्सज्जवीर्यासि सा at जिन्व ॥२६॥

Asadha’si sahamana sahasvaratih sahasva
prtanayatah. Sahasraviry@’si sa ma jinva.
Ruling power, Shakti, you are tolerant,
challenging and invincible. Challenge the mean, the
ungenerous and the destructive forces. Face, fight and
defeat those who are bent upon violence. You have the
strength and prowess of a thousand powers. Be good to
me, be good and gracious to all.

27. (Vishvedeva Devata, Gotama Rshi)
मधु वार्ताऽऋतायते मर्धु ania faeta: 1
areal}: सन्त्वोर्षधी: ॥२७॥

Madhu vata’rtayate madhu ksaranti sindhavah.
Madhvirnah santvosadhth.

The winds blow cool and sweet as honey. The
streams and ocean-currents flow cool and sweet as
honey. May the herbs and trees be as sweet and pleasant
as honey. (Let us too be good and sweet in our conduct
as the winds, the streams and the herbs and trees,
observing the law and ethics of value.)

28. (Vishvedeva Devata, Gotama Rshi)

मधु द्यौरस्तु न: frat wren

Madhu naktamutosaso madhumat parthivam
rajah. Madhu dyaurastu nah pita.
