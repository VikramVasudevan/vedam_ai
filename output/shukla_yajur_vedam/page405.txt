372 YAJURVEDA

May the nights and the dawn be honey-sweet,
soothing and inspiring. May the dust of mother-earth
be sweet and fragrant. And may the light of the sun be
honey-sweet and kind as father for us all. (Let us too
follow the honey-sweets of nature in life.)

29. (Vishvedeva Devata, Gotama Rshi)

मर्धुमान्नो वनस्पतिर्मर्धुमाँ२॥ऽअस्तु Ga: |
माध्वीर्गावो भवन्तु A: ॥२९॥

Madhumanno vanaspatirmadhuman’ astu
suryah. Madhvirgavo bhavantu nah.

May the herbs with their juices and the trees with
their fruit be honey-sweet for us. May the sun be kind,
sweet and invigorating. May the cows be sweet and
rejuvenating as honey with their milk. May the saints,
scholars, seniors and teachers be kind and affectionate
as the sun, the mother earth and the mother cow.

30. (Prajapati Devata, Gotama Rshi)
अपां Tet<dia मा त्वा सूर्योऽभिर्ताप्सीन्माग्निर्वैश्वानर:।
अच्छिन्नपत्रा: wsissiqdiacand त्वा दिव्या afte:
PAA ॥३०॥

Apam gambhantsida ma tva suryo’bhi tapsin
ma’ gnirvaisvanarah. Acchinnapatrah praja’
anuviksasvanu tva divya vrstih sacatam.

Be in the centre of the waters deep as in the clouds
so that the heat of the sun may not injure you nor the
earthly heat, Vaishwanara, hurt you. Look round so that
the people, free and fully protected from heat, are
favourable to you. May the showers of celestial rain
bless you.
