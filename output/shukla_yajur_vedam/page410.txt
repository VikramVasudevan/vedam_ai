Agni, Lord of light and life, agni, man of science,
is brilliant with the light of knowledge, illustrious with
the lustre and splendour of power, golden lovable and
blissful, and giver of a thousand gifts. We do homage
to you for the innumerable gifts of prosperity, comfort
and happiness.

With oblations of milk, honour the rising sun
which holds in its womb and reveals innumerable forms

to live a hundred years. Never never be proud.
