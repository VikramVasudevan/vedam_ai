378 YAJURVEDA

Vatasya jutim varunasya nabhimasvam
jajnanam sarirasya madhye. Sisum nadinam
harimadribudhnamagne ma himsth parame
vyoman.

Agni, universal power, man of knowledge and
power, hurt not the velocity of the wind and the centre
of the water and vapours. Hurt not anything that is
creative and procurative in the midst of the world. Injure
not the produce of rivers, the clouds and anything grown
on the mountains. Kill not the birds and aquatic
creatures. Kill not anything that saves from suffering
and evil.

43. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)

अर्जस्त्रमिन्दुंमरुषं भुरण्युमग्निरमींडे पूर्वचित्तिं नमोंभि:। a
पर्वभिर्ऋतुश: coda गां मा हिंश्सीररदितिं विरार्जम्॥४३॥

Ajasramindumarusam bhuranyumagnimide

purvacittim namobhih. Sa parvabhirrtusah
kalpamano gam ma himstraditim virajam.

I worship Agni, eternal power, bright and fiery,

lord of peace and bliss, and giver of health and vigour.

With all means and materials I study and develop
the power of fire and electricity collected and developed
by the ancients. I proceed season by season, planning
and achieving stage by stage.

Agni, man of science and power, do not kill,
destroy or injure the productive cow, the creative earth
so bright and unviolated, and the restorative
environment.
