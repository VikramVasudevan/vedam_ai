CHAPTER-XIII 379
44. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)
महीश्डसांहस्त्रीमसुरस्य मायामग्ने मा हिंश्सी: a
व्योंमन् ॥४४॥

Varutrim tvasturvarunasya nabhimavim jajna-
nam rajasah parasmat. Mahim sahasrim-
asurasya mayamagne ma himsth parame
vyoman.

Agni, man of knowledge and power, do not
injure, do not destroy, the protective power of the sun,
the binding power of water, the lightning energy of the
cloud born of regions beyond the sky, and the great,
generous and regenerative earth, giver of a thousand
blessings.

45. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)
योऽअग्निरग्नेरध्यर्जायत शोकात्पृथिव्याऽउत at दिवस्परि]।

Yo agniragneradhyajayata ऽलाद्ता prthivya’uta va
divaspari. Yena praja viSvakarma jajana
tamagne hedah pari te vrnaktu.

Agni, man of science and power, the vital fire
and creative energy that was born of the flames of the
cosmic yajna of Agni, Lord of life and light, illuminates
the wide world and heaven, and with it Vishwakarma,
the Lord Maker of all forms, makes the various forms
of life in existence. May your passion for knowledge
and power spare that creative energy from hurt and
damage.
