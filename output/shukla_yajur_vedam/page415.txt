882 YAJURVEDA

best of places, do not kill the cow and the bull, infinitely
useful, and spring of a hundred streams and showers of
milk and ghee for the people. It is holy and worthy of
protection and development. I advise you, turn your
attention to the wild cow and the bull and other animals.
Growing and developing the economy with animal and
forest wealth, feel settled with yourself and your land.
Let your attention be directed to the wild cow and the
forest wealth. Let your concern take on those who hurt
us.

50. (Agni Devata, Virupa Rshi)
त्वष्टु: प्रजार्नो प्रथमं जनित्रमग्ने मा feet: परमे व्योंमन्।
उष्ट्मारण्यमरनुं a दिशामि at चिन्वानस्तन्वो Frat ।
se ते wpe यं द्विष्मस्तं ते शुर्गृच्छतु ॥५०॥

Agni, noble ruler, in the wonderful world of the
Supreme Lord, do not hurt, do not kill the sheep and
other such animals, one of the first creations of Twashta,
the maker of the world, and source of comfort and
providers of woollen cover to the human beings and
the animals. I point out to the wild camel and other wild
animals. Growing and developing the economy with
that animal wealth, be at peace with yourself in your
land. Let your concern turn to the camel. Let it be
directed to those who hurt us.
