886 YAJURVEDA

the enlightening anushtup verses,

I initiate you with the knowledge contained in
the clear exhilarating pankti verses of the Veda.

54. (Pranas Devatas, Ushana Rshi)
र्गायत्री र्वांसन्ती whee र्गांयत्रं र्गायत्रादुंपाश्छंशुरूंपाछ-
त्वयां प्राणं र्गृह्णामि प्रजार्थ्य: esi

Ayam puro bhuvastasya prano bhauvayano
vasantah pranayano gayatri vasanti gayatryai
gayatram gayatradupamsurupamsostrivrt
trivrto rathantaram vasistha’ rsih prajapati-
egrhitaya tvaya pranam grhnami prajabhyah.

This Agni, universal spirit, is the first and
foremost in existence, the eastern horizon of the world.
Its offspring is prana, vital energy, life-breath of
existence. The offspring of prana is spring. The song of
spring is gayatri, joy. Joy is the music of spring from
gayatri, the gayatra saman, soft, sweet and low. From
gayatra, the upanshu, the receiver of soma, ladle for
libation. And from the upanshu, creation of trivrit, the
person dedicated to trivrit, threefold integrated Dharma
of knowledge, action and prayer. From trivrit, the
successful man, sociable, visionary and saviour.

Woman of knowledge, virtue and love, blest by
Prajapati, lord of creation, alongwith you I receive the
vital energy of prana for the sake of children and family.
