On the right (south) is the spirit and power of the
divine, Vishwakarma, like vayu, wind and electric
energy, the divine agency by which is accomplished
every action and movement of the world. The offspring
of Vishwakarma is the mind, desire and action. The
offspring of mind is summer. Trishtup meter is the
expression of summer. From trishtup is born swara-sama
of heat and lustre as the mid-day. From swara comes
the antaryama, the silent libation of soma with self-
control. From antaryama comes/is born the fifteen-phase
stoma (pancha-dasha-stoma), expression of joy and
hilarity. From pancha-dasha stoma comes Brihat-saman,
the great saman song of jubilation and celebration. The
seer expert of Brihat-saman is Bharadwaja, man of full
knowledge and prosperity.

Woman of knowledge, virtue and love, blest by
Prajapati, alongwith you I receive mana, mind, that is,
love and desire for the sake of family and community.
