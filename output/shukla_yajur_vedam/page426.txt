CHAPTER-XIV 393

Prthivyah purisamasyapso nama tam tva visve
abhi grnantu devah. Stomaprstha ghrtavatiha
sida prajavadasme dravina”- yajasvasvina’-
dhvaryu sadayatamiha tva.

Noble lady of the house, you are the protector of
the earth (fulfilment of this earthly home). You are sweet
and liquid as the waters of life. May all the noble and
enlightened people appraise, approve and honour you
whole heartedly. Blest with plenty and prosperity of
means and materials, keen lover of ritual hymns and
yajna sessions, take your rightful place here. Blest with
progeny, wealth and honour, win for us the best of life
and joy. May the saints and sages of light and the guides
of yajna consecrate you here in this home.

5. (Ashvinis Devata, Ushana Rshi)

अर्दित्यास्त्वा os सादयाम्यन्तरिंक्षस्य ett विष्टम्भनीं

On the floor of this earth (in this home) I seat
and consecrate you, lady of the inner world of the heart,
firm support of the home-life in all directions, mistress
and presiding presence of all the residences. You are
the ripples of joy on the streams of life. Indeed you are
conceived and created by Vishwakarma, the cosmic
artist. May the Ashwinis, torch bearers of life, and the
adhvaryus, experts of yajnic life, guide and sanctify you
here.
