CHAPTER-XIV 405

Ma chandah prama chandah pratima chando’
asrivayaschandah panktischanda’usnik chando
brhati chando’nustup chando virat chando
gayatri chandas tristup chando jagati chandah.

Measure is the secret of happiness. Reason is the
measure of intelligence. Freedom is the condition of
truth incarnate. Practical science is the means of
strength, prosperity and brightness. Five-fold yoga is
the giver of light. Nature is the sustenance of life.
Attachment to pleasure is bhoga (sufferance). The light
of knowledge is science. The protector of gayatri is its
realization. The well-being of body, mind and soul is
happiness. The dynamics of existence lies in
omnipotence.

And these are the themes of Vaidic verses.

understanding and measure of time. Stars are free in
their orbits. Speech is the medium of truth. Mind is the
seat of honesty. Farming is the source of production.
Gold leads to pleasure. Cow is the mother of joy and
plenty. Goat gives joy. Horse loves freedom. Know this
and follow.
