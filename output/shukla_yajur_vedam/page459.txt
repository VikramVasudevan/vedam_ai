426 YAJURVEDA

May this lord of yours and the Lord sustainer of
the world and all those powers who know, together in
unison, establish you and the yajamana on the heights
of the heavenly regions of bliss.

12. (Adityas Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)

You are the lady of brilliance and bliss like the
soothing light of the Western direction. All the twelve
Adityas, stars of light and powers of energy, are your
divine protectors. Varuna, Lord of waters and controller
of evil, wards off your suffering. May the Saptadasha
(seventeen part) stoma settle you on the earth. May the
Marutvatiya Uktha and the libations firmly stabilize you
against doubt and disturbance. May the Vairupa Sama
hymns extend your honour to the skies. May the
foremost Rshis, saints and scholars spread your honour
and fame with the measure of your heavenly excellence
