CHAPTER-XV 433

Ayamuparyarvagvasustasya senajicca susena-
Sca senanigramanyau. Urvasi ca purva-

This on top, after rains and autumn, is the winter
season, treasure-giver of wealth. Like a king’s
commander of the forces and the chief of his city, are
the two months of Marga-Shirsha and Pausha, one like
a lord of the hosts, the other victorious. The spirit of
great love and freedom and the spirit of winsome beauty
of the heart are two powers of the season. The roar of
thunder is the weapon and lightning is another and
greater one.

Salutations to the winter months and their gifts
and powers. May they save us. May they be good and
auspicious. Whoever violates our life and whoever we
oppose in defence, we deliver unto the judgement of
the powers of defence and the spirit of nature.

20. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)

atapet fea: ककुत्पर्ति: पृथिव्याऽअयम् |

Agnirmurdha divah kakut patih prthivya’ ayam.
Apa retamsi jinvati.

In winter, this Agni, shining supreme as the lord
of space between the earth and heaven like the sun, rules
and illuminates the directions and inspires the vitalities
of life with new energy.
