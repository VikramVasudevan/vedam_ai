power, who showers rains of bliss over the earth and
her children.

26. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
state Maat ent धातृभिर्होता यर्जिष्ठोऽअध्वरेष्वीरड्य:।
wAciart yet विरुरुचुर्वनेषु fart farsa विशे-
fast ॥२६॥

Ayamiha prathamo dhayi dhatrbhirhota yajistho’
adhvaresvidyah. Yamapnavano bhrgavo
virurucurvanesu citram vibhvam vise vise.

This agni here, first and foremost power of nature,
lighted and established in the vedi by dedicated saints
and sages, is worthiest of reverence and esteem. It is
most valuable for development through creative and
constructive acts of yajna. Present as it is, wonderful
and universal, in the rays of the sun and currents of
energy, the most intelligent and versatile men of genius
develop it for the general good of the people.

27. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
जर्नस्य Tossivitre जार्गृविरग्नि: सुदर्क्ष: सुविताय
नर्व्यसे । Faucet deat दिंविस्पृशां द्युमद्बिभाति भरतेभ्य:
strat: ॥२७॥

Janasya gopa’ajanista jagrviragnih sudaksah
suvitaya navyase. Ghrtapratiko brhata divisprsa
dyumad vibhati bharatebhyah sucih.

Agni (fire and electricity), pure and sacred,
protector of the people, ever wakeful, versatile and
generous, source and symbol of plenty and prosperity,
came into existence for new and newer good and
excellence of the people, and shines brilliant with
heaven-touching grandeur.
