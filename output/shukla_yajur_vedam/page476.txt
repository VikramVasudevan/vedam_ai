CHAPTER-XV 443

43. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Rshi)
34 dears सर्पिषो adf श्रीणीषऽआसर्नि 1 sat
नऽउरत्युपूर्याऽउक्थेर्षु शवसस्पतऽइर्षश्रंस्तोतृभ्यऽआ भरं ॥४३॥

Ubhe suscandra sarpiso darvi Srinisa’asani. Uto
na’ utpupurya’ukthesu Savasaspata’isam
stotrbhya’a bhara.

Graceful power of heat, light and knowledge, you
burn two ladles of ghee in the mouth (vedi of yajna)
and diffuse the light and fragrance in the air through
the cross currents of the wind. Lord of strength and
power of creation, fill the stores of food with grain for
us and the minds with knowledge for those who offer
oblations and chant the hymns of praise in yajna.

Brilliant holy Sire of knowledge and power, just
as the holy fire burns two ladlefuls of ghee in the vedi
to diffuse the light and fragrance in the air, similarly
you hold for us the two-fold knowledge of nature and
spirit to disseminate it among the disciples who come
to the school of yajna for education and sing the songs
of the Vedas in praise of Agni, omniscient Lord of light
and knowledge. Fill our minds with knowledge and the
power of knowledge.

अग्ने तमद्याश्वं न स्तोमै: क्रतुं न भद्रशर्हदिस्पृर्शम् |
seat assite: ॥४४॥

Agne tamadyasvam na stomaih kratum na
bhadram hrdisprsam. Rdhyama ta’ ohaih.

Agni, lord of light and knowledge, like the horse
broke in to perfection by training, like the holy yajna
completed and perfected with the hymns of divine
