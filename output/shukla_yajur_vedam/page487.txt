454 YAJURVEDA

suffering, attainment of knowledge, noble strength of
character, honour and dignity and high performance of
duty. Emanate the light of love and justice. Promote
Dharma and piety. And do not pollute the heavens, do
not damage the light of learning.

May the Sun, supreme light of the world, wholly
protect you and bless you with great good fortune, peace
of mind and the light of truth.

Noble man and virtuous wife, may both of you
stay firm and steadfast with that supreme God of life
and the universe as with the breath of life.

सहस्स्य waft सहस्त्रस्य ufenft ascent
aeaista weet त्वा nei

Sahasrasya pramasi sahasrasya pratima’ si
sahasrasyonma’si sahasro’si sahasraya tva.

Learned man, you are the master of a thousand
facts of life and nature. You are the measure of a
thousand confirmations of knowledge. You are the
reference and judge for a thousand doubts and questions.
You are the lord and authority over a thousand problems
of science and existence. May the Lord Omniscient of
existence grant you your rightful place in the world for
a thousand achievements.
