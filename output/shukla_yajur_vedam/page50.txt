Yajna is not a sharp-edged weapon of destruction
but a peaceful mode of regeneration. The lawless are
uprooted, the selfish are driven out. I take up the yajna
materials for the recuperative purpose and consecrate
these for the offering. The force of yajna is positive, of
love and non-violence, but it is most effective in
operation. It corrects the lawless, converts the selfish
and eliminates the destructive. I honor this power for
the sustenance of nature, life and humanity.

Yajna, you are the nectar of life for the earth. You
are the presence of Vishnu, the creative power of yajna.
You are life on the earth and light in the sky. You are the
tongue of Agni, tasting the sweets of life. I see this
presence in truth with steady and blessed eye for the
sake of food, energy, and the light of life, in every place
and in every chant of mantra. You are so close, invoked
so freely, so be gracious for me too.
