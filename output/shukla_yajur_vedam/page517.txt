484 YAJURVEDA

Ya’etavantasca bhuyaimsasca diso rudra
vitasthire. Tesain sahasrayojane’va dhanvani
tanmasti.

And Rudra powers (of beneficence, affliction and
retribution in nature) conceived and realized so far and
even more exist variously in all the directions (on the
earth, in the sky and in heaven). We deal with their arms
and armaments appropriately with all our might and
mind in faith (worshipping, extending, negating or
fighting and eliminating) in a thousand ways over vast
areas of time and space.

64. (Rudras Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Va Deva Rshi)
नर्मोऽस्तु रुद्रेभ्यो ये fafa येर्षो वर्षमिर्षव: 1
तेभ्यो दश प्राचीर्दर्शं दक्षिणा ast प्रतीचीर्दशोदीचीर्दशोर्धघ्वा:।
तेभ्यो नरमोंऽअस्तु ते र्नोऽवन्तु a at मृडयन्तु a a द्विष्मो
ase नो द्वेष्टि तर्मेषां wet दध्म: ॥६४॥

Namo’stu rudrebhyo ye divi yesam varsa-
misavah. Tebhyo dasa pracirdasa daksina dasa
praticirdasodicirdasordhvah. Tebhyo namo’astu
te no’ vantu te no mrdayantu te yam dvismo
Yasca no dvesti tamesam jambhe dadhmah.

Homage to the Rudras that abide in heaven. Rain
is their power and gift to life. To them our salutations
with folded hands with ten fingers joined, with ten
senses and ten pranas. For them the ten directions east,
ten directions south, ten directions west, ten directions
north, and ten directions above; all these for them to
pervade and operate. Salutations to them! May they
protect us! May they bless us! Whosoever we hate,
whosoever hate us, him we deliver unto their power for
judgement and redress.
