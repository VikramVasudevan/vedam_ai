486 YAJURVEDA

Homage to the Rudras that abide on the earth.
Food and energy is their power and gift to life. To them
our salutations with folded hands with ten fingers joined,
with ten senses and ten pranas. For them the ten
directions east, ten directions south, ten directions west,
ten directions north, and ten directions above; all these
for them to pervade and operate. Salutations to them!
May they protect us! May they bless us! Whosoever we
hate, whosoever hate us, him we deliver unto their power
for judgement and redress.
