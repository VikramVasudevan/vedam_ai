488 YAJURVEDA

ca samudrasca madhyam cantasca parardha-
Scaita me’agna istaka dhenavah santvamutra-
musminilloke.

Agni, fire-lord of yajna, may these bricks of my
altar (vedi), wanted values of life, one and all, be
generous and productive and grow ten times in
geometrical progression : May one grow to ten, and ten
to one hundred (shatam), and one hundred to one
thousand (sahasram), and one thousand to ten thousand
(ayutam), and ten thousand to hundred thousand (one
lac, niyutam), and hundred thousand to a million
(prayutam), and one million to hundred million
(arbudam), and hundred million to a billion (arba,
nyarbudam), and one billion to ten billion (one kharba),
and ten billion to a hundred billion (one nikharba), and
hundred billion to a trillion (mahapadma), and one
trillion to ten trillion (one shanku), and ten trillion to
hundred trillion (one samudra), and hundred trillion to
quadrillion (one madhyam), and one madhyam to ten
madhyam (anta, ten quadrillion), and one anta to ten
anta (hundred quadrillion), parardha. And these bricks,
wanted values, be, like cows, the givers of fulfilment to
me in this life and beyond, in this world and beyond.
