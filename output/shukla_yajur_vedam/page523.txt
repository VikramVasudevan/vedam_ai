490 YAJURVEDA

Agni, clad in the brilliant flames of light, come
upon the earth, descend in the midst of the earth’s
abundance. Descend into the streams of life. Since you
are the life and lustre of the waters, come with that life
and lustre. Come and bless this yajna of our home with
peace and prosperity.

7. (Agni Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

अपामिदं न्यर्यनश्समुद्रस्य निवेर्शनम् | अन्याँस्तेंऽअस्मर्त्तपन्तु
हेतर्य: पावकोऽअस्मर्थभ्यश्शिवो Wat ei

Apamidam nyayanam samudrasya nivesanam.
Anyanste’asmattapantu hetayah pavako’
asmabhyain sivo bhava.

This home is the abode of peace as the sky is the
abode of waters. It is an abode of the depth of life as the
deep ocean is. May Agni, lord of yajna and life and
lustre of the waters be kind and gracious to us in this
home of yajna, and may the heat of his passion and
displeasure be directed elsewhere away from us.

8. (Agni Devata, Vasuyu Rshi)
अग्ने पावक रोचिषां मन्द्रयां देव reat |
आ dardiat यक्षिं च neu
Agne pavaka rocisaé mandrayda deva jihvaya. A
devan vaksi yaksi ca.

Agni, generous lord of light, purifier and
sanctifier of life, with your brilliant and exhilarating
tongue of flames you call the noble yajnic devotees
together and proclaim to them the truths of eternity.
