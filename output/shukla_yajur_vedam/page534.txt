CHAPTER-XVII 501

seated at the centre of the mother force, Prakriti, and he
is the lord presiding over existence, wherein reside all
the worlds of the universe.

31. (Vishvakarma Devata, Vishvakarma Rshi)

न तं विंदाथ यऽइमा जजानान्यद्युष्माकमन्तरं बभूव ।
नीहारेण wed जल्प्यां चासुतृपंऽउक्थशार्सश्चरन्ति ॥३१॥

Na tam vidatha ya’ima jajananyadyusmakam-
antaram babhuva. Niharena pravrta jalpya
casutrpa ’ukthasasascaranti.

You don’t know Him who has created all these
worlds. He is different and distant from you all, and yet
within you all. People sunk in darkness roam around
quoting scripture but serving their own selfish ends with
empty words void of vision.

32. (Vishvakarma Devata, Bhuvanputro Vishvakarma Rshi)

विश्वर्कर्मा ह्यर्जनिष्ट देवऽआदिद् theratsatstag द्वितीर्य:।
तृतीर्य: पिता र्जनितौर्षधीनामपां गर्भं व्यदधात्पुरुत्रा usu

Visvakarma hyajanista deva’adidgandharvo’
abhavad dvitiyah. Trtiyah pita janit-
ausadhinamapam garbham vyadadhat purutra.

Lord Vishvakarma, creator of the world, self-
effulgent lord of light and life, first manifested in
existence. Then after that was born the sun which holds
the earth. The third was the cloud which, in its womb,
holds the waters, offspring of the sky and the winds,
vital air, and generates and sustains the herbs and trees
in many ways.
