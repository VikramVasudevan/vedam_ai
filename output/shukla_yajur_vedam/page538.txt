Indra, valiant commander, relentless warrior of
a hundred fold righteous ardour, penetrating deep into
enemy defences with his strength of armour, irresistible,
invincible, victor of enemy forces, may direct and defend
our army and lead it to victory.

40. (Indra Devata, Apratiratha Rshi)

इन्द्रऽआसां नेता बृहस्पतिर्दक्षिणा यज्ञ: UTSU सोर्म:।
देवसेनानामभिभञ्जतीनां जर्यन्तीनां weal यन्त्वर्ग्रम् ॥४०॥

Indra’asam neta brhaspatirdaksina yajnah pura’
etu somah. Devasenanamabhibhanjatinam
jJayantinam maruto yantvagram.

The commander of those noble and enlightened
armies which break down and conquer the forces of
evil in life is Indra, a man of power and grandeur; he is
Brihaspati, a man of grandeur, knowledge and
magnanimity; he is Soma, the man of magnanimity,
peace and joy; he is the candid expert on the right side
of the nation; he is the clarion call for unity and progress,
and he is the first among all to take the lead in advance
in a crisis. At his call the Maruts, commandos of the
first order, must storm the citadel of the enemy.
