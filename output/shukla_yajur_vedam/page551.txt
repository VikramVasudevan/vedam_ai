518 YAJURVEDA

Those virtuous men of knowledge who perform
yajna and expand it, yajna which sustains the whole
world, they expect nothing of the material world and,
through yoga, rise above the earth and heaven and
ascend to the regions of bliss and light divine.

69. (Agni Devata, Vidhriti Rshi)

अग्ने Ue प्रथमो देवयतां चक्षुर्देवार्नामुत ears |
इर्यक्षमाणा भूर्गुभि: सजोषा: स्वर्यन्तु यर्जमाना: स्वस्ति॥६९॥

Agne prehi prathamo devayatam caksurdeva-
namuta martyanam. Iyaksamana bhrgubhih
sajosah svaryantu yajamanah svasti.

Agni, man of knowledge and yajna, you are the
first among men on way to godliness. You are the eye
for the average humans as you have the vision of the
men of divinity.

May the people of faith and love full of devotion
dedicated to yajna and performing yajna with men of
knowledge and vision of divinity enjoy peace and
happiness and ascend to the heaven of bliss and life
divine.

70. (Agni Devata, Kutsa Rshi)

नक्तोषासा सर्मनसा विरूंपे धापयेंते शिशुमेर्कंश्समीची |
maa रूक्मोऽअन्तर्बिर्भाति देवाऽअग्नि apa
द्रविणोदा: ॥७०॥

Naktosadsa samanasa virupe dhapayete
Sisumekam samict. Dyavaksama rukmo’
antarvibhati deva’agnim dharayan dravinodah.

Just as the mother and the nurse, different of
character and status but of equal mind and common
