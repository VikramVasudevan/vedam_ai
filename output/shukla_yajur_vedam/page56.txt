potential grace this blessed home with all the gifts of
peace, freedom and progress. Be with this happy place,
dwell here with all power, potential and grace, firm,
secure, inviolable, in this blessed home of yajna, the
seat of truth and righteousness. Vishnu, Lord
Omnipresent and Universal yajna, protect all these,
preserve and advance the yajna, protect and bless the
yajnapati, save me and protect and advance the
organization and system of yajna.

7. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

amt वाजजिद् art त्वा सरिष्यन्ते artistas स्म्माञ्मि।
wat dasa: caer faged: सुयमे A भूयास्तम् igi

Agne vajajid vajam tva sarisyantam vajajitam
sammarjm. Namo devebhyah svadha pitrbhyah
suyame me bhiuyastam.

Agni is the Lord of light and life, it is fire both
physical and vital. It is the giver and purifier of food
and the secret of victory and glory. It is fast in motion
and action, burning up the libations and sending them
up into the sky. I worship Agni and refine agni through
yajna for food and energy, light and victory. Salutations
to the Devas, celestial powers of light; food for the Pitris,
powers of nourishment. May they both help us with food
and energy to win honour and glory for us.
