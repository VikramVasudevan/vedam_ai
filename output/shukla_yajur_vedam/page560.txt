I wish to mix and go deep into water/ghee for
offering it into the fire. Fire arises from water/ghee,
which is its birth-place. It is latent in water/ghee. Water/
ghee is its place of rest. Prepare the materials for the
libation and call up Agni. Generous power of rain
shower, prepare the materials for the offering and make
us all rejoice. (The indication is to prepare the waters
and produce fire/energy from this rich source.)

Honey waves of energy arise from the sea/vedi
and, mixing with the rays of the sun, ascend to a state
of divine vitality. These rising waves are tongues of the
gods (divine powers of nature), and the central birth-
place of nectar. These are the mystical names of the
mysterious but still scientific powers of ghrta/the sea
through the process of yajna.
