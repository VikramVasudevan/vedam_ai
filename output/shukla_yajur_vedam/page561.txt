528 YAJURVEDA

90. (Agni Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)
aa नाम प्ररव्रवामा घृतस्यास्मिन् यज्ञे ara नर्मोभि: ।
sd gen र्शणवच्छस्यमांनं चर्तु:शृङ्गोऽवमीद् गौरऽ-
Wad ॥९०॥
Vayam nama pra bravama ghrtasyasmin yajne
dharayama namobhih. Upa brahma srna-
vacchasyamanam catuhsrngo’vamid gaura टाता

In this yajna we chant and meditate upon the
mystical name of ‘yajna’, of ghee, waters and the spirit
of fertility, and with all reverence, salutations, faith and
holy offerings, observe, perform and internalize yajna
as name and as the creative act that it is. May Brahma,
the presiding priest, man of the Vedas and generous
teacher, hear the celebrated name and expound its
meaning and value to others.

91. (Yajna Purusha Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)

चत्वारि शृङ्गा त्रयोंऽअस्य पादा द्वे शीर्षे सप्त हस्तांसोऽअस्य।
त्रिर्धां बद्धो र्वृषभो रोरवीति महो देवो aeiteus
आर्बिवेश।॥।९१॥

Catvari srnga trayo’asya pada dve Ssirse sapta
hastaso’asya. Tridha baddho vrsabho roraviti
maho devo martydan’a vivesa.

(i). Yajna is a purusha, a living person, a metaphor.
Just as a person is a living human being, and he/she has
a name which is identical with the person, so is yajna, a
living act and a name, and the name-word is identical
with the act. (1) This person, the living act of yajna, has
four heads, the four Vedas. It has three legs/sessions:
morning, mid-day and evening. It has two heads, the
prayaniya ceremony (inauguration), and the udayaniya
