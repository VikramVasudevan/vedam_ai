ceremony (valediction or conclusion). It has seven arms
in the form of seven chhandas, gayatri and other metres.
It is tied three-ways, structured in three parts: Mantra,
the original vedic texts, Brahmana, expositions
containing rules and explanations, and kalpa, rules of
ritual performance. It is Vrishabha, that which showers
joy and prosperity. It roars with the voice of the Vedas.
It is great, it is brilliant and divine, and it is seated in
the deepest layers of the human mind.

(11). Now the name ‘ Yajna’, the word in language:
It has four heads: Nama, nouns or substantives, Akhyata,
the roots and verbs, Upasarga, the affixes, and Nipata,
particles, indeclinables and irregulars. It has three legs:
past, present and future tenses. It has two heads: the
eternal Word and the structured words of language in
use, and the word and its meaning (signification). It has
seven arms: the seven cases and case endings or case
forms. It is tied three ways: in the mind/intellect, in the
chest, and in the throat/mouth. It is a Vrishabha, it
showers the thoughts and emotions in communication,
and it roars through the medium of sound. It is great, it
is rich and brilliant and it is seated in the deepest layers
of the human mind.

(This mantra gives a comprehensive abstract of
the linguistic structure of any language, and on the basis
of this abstract a universal grammar of human language,
any form of it, can be written.)
