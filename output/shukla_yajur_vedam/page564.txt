CHAPTER-XVII 531

These waves of divine energy, vibrations of the
divine voice issue forth from yajna and, purified by the
mind in faith, flow serene and quiet like streams through
the heart within, away from the fluctuations of the outer

fearless troop of horse breaking through the enemy
defences goes forth to victory winning over the field
with the speed of its motion in the heat of action.

Just like young women of equal mind and

pleasing, noble and generous, smiling in festive mood,
the streams of ghrita (ghee) flow from all round and
