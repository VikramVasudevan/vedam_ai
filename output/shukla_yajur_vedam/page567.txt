By yajna, by the Grace of God, by virtue of our
joint action, by virtue of my own performance: food is
mine and energy is mine; prosperity is mine and the
way to prosperity is mine; effort is mine and the will to
effort is mine; management is mine and preservation is
mine; faith is mine and firmness is mine; vision 1s mine
and resolution is mine; freedom is mine and discipline
is mine; praise is mine and the tongue is mine; the heard
is mine and the spoken is mine; shruti (Veda) is mine
and Smriti (law and tradition) is mine; light is mine and
illumination is mine; joy 18 mine and supreme bliss is
mine; all these may grow, all these be favourable; all
these be auspicious for all, by yajna.
