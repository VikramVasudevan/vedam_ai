CHAPTER-XVIII 535

Pranasca me’ panasca me vyanasca me’ susca
me cittam ca ma’adhitam ca me vak ca me
manasca me caksusca me srotram ca me
daksasca me balam ca me yajnena kalpantam.

By yajna, by the Grace of God, by the blessings
and goodwill of the community, and by virtue of my
own discipline: my life and the breath of life, the
outgoing air and systemic cleansing, the joints and
suppleness of the body, my will to live and the spirit of
joy, my mind and my memory, my resolution and
meditation, my speech and listening, my thought and
self-image, my eye and love of direct truth, my ear and
search for confirmation, my expertise and my smartness,
my strength and prowess, all these may grow, be
favourable and auspicious for all, by yajna.

My vigour and my power, my victory and my
moral courage, my soul and my potential, my body and
health, my home and my family, my defence and my
weapons, my limbs and their functions, my bones and
my blood, my generation and my vitality, the bodies
and health of my people, my life and longevity, my old
age and self-dependence, all these may grow, be good
