24 YAJURVEDA

Askannamadya devebhya’ ajyam sambhriyasa-
manghrinad visno ma tvavakramisam vasumati-
magne te cchayamupasthesam visno sthanam-
astta’ indro viryamakrnodurdhvo’dhvara’
asthat.

Vishnu, Lord Omnipresent, universal yajna, I
bring libations of ghee, pure and secure, for the devas
through the fire of the vedi. Agni, Lord of Yajna, may I
never neglect or violate yajna, and I pray I may always
live in your protective shade. The fire in the vedi is the
seat of Vishnu. It rises from the vedi to the vast sky and
from there the sun and wind carry it all round and
convert it into the noblest acts of the devotees.

9. (Agni Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

द्यावांपृथिवी Reteqnenass-gssteen हविर्षा भूत्स्वाहा
सं ज्योर्तिषा ज्योर्ति: ॥९॥

Agne verhotram verdutyamavatam tvam
dyavaprthivi’ ava tvam dyavaprthivi svistakrd-
devebhya’ indra’ajyena havisa bhitsvaha sam
Jyotisa jyotih.

Agni, Lord of light and life, protect the act of
yajna into the fire, protect the fiery rise of fragrance
into the sky, protect the heaven and the earth, and may
the heaven and the earth carry on your blessed purpose
of yajna. May the sun, light of the world, with its
radiance convert the libation of holy materials into the
richest food for nature and for holy men. This is the
voice of Divinity.
