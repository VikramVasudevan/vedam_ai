CHAPTER -XVIII 541

All my thought and whatever I have thought out,
all that I know and ought to know, my past and my
present, all my future and all my timeless, all my short-
cuts and my proper actions, my treatments and my
diagnoses, my riches and my achievement, my spiritual
wealth and my fulfilments, my intentions and my
imaginations, my reflections and my reasons, my
understanding and my analyses, my intelligence and my
faith and commitments, all these may grow, and be
strong and auspicious by yajna for all.

My paddy and rice, and my barley, and my beans,
and my sesamums, and my mungo beans, and my
legumins, and my long pepper, and my small grains,
and my millet, and my wild grains, and my wheat, and
my lentils and all other grains, and their preparations,
may all these grow in plenty, rich and delicious, by yajna
and scientific treatment for all.
