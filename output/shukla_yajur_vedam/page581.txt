548 YAJURVEDA

Srucasca me camasaSca me vayavyani ca me
dronakalasasSca me gravanasca me’ dhisavane
came putabhrcca ma’adhavaniyasca me vedisca
me barhisca me’vabhrthasca me svagakarasca
me yajnena kalpantam.

My ladles and their cleaning, my bowls and their
contents, my aerial apparatuses and their maintenance
and function, and my soma vessels, and my urns and
jugs, and my stone presses and mortars and pestles, and
my handpress and the soma plants, and my urns of pure
soma, and the vessels for clearing and filtering soma,
and the yajna altar, and my holy grass and the feather
broom, and my holy bath and ablutions, and my
valedictory chant of joy at the completion of yajna :
may all these grow and be good and auspicious for me
and for all by yajna.

22. (Yajnavanatma Devata, Devas Rshis)

sifaee मे ative Asche मे सूर्यश्च A wie

Sakvarayo disasca me yajnena kalpantam.

My fire and my use of fire, my hymns of worship
and the singers, my passion and cool of mind, my
sunlight and my warmth of living, my vital breath and
air-energy, my nation and its policy and governance,
my earth mother and her riches, my ethics and self-
control, my imperishable wealth and my earthly life,
