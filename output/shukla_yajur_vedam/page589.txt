556 YAJURVEDA

questions, heights and foundations of life grow by yajna,
may the yajna of Dharma grow by the yajna, pursuit of
Dharma, may the hymns of praise and celebration of
the Divine, the Yajus, the Riks, and the Samans, the
Brihat Sama and Rathantara Sama also grow by yajna.
May the noble people attain to the eternal joy of
immortality. May we all attain to you and immortality.
May we all be the children of the Lord and father of the
universe by the truth of word and deed.

30. (Rajyavanatma Devata, Devas Rshis)

वार्जस्य 4 dae मातरॆ महीमदिंतिं नाम aetar करामहे।
धर्म` साविषत् ॥३०॥

Vajasya nu prasave mataram mahimaditim
nama vacasa karamahe. Yasyamidam visvam
bhuvanamavivesa tasyam no devah savita
dharma savisat.

In this Lord Omnipotent’s yajna of life and
sustenance, we celebrate with holy songs of Divinity,
the Veda, the great inviolable Mother Nature in whom
reside the entire worlds of existence. May Savita, lord
creator and generator of life strengthen and promote
our Dharma in the lap of the mother within the Law.

31. (Vishvedevas Devata, Devas Rshis)

fasdssra wedt fasdsadt fasd भवन्त्वग्नय:
सर्मिद्धा:। विश्वे नो देवाऽअवसार्गमन्तु fasdued द्रविंणं
वार्जोऽअस्मे ॥३१॥

Visve’adya maruto visva’uti visve bhavant-

vagnayah samiddhah. Visve no deva’avasa
gamantu visvamastu dravinam vajo’asme.
