26 YAJURVEDA

of Ashwinis and the hands of Pusha, nature’s currents of
energy and the motions of vital air. Yes, with my own
mouth, I take in the food and inhale the breath of life
from the vital fire of the Lord’s yajna. This is the voice
of Divinity.

12. (Savita Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

Ud d da सवितर्यज्ञं wedged ब्रह्मर्णे |
at यज्ञर्मव at sada तेन ara ॥१२॥

Etam te deva savitaryajnam prahurbrhaspataye
brahmane. Tena yajnamava tena yajnapatim
tena mamava.

Lord Savita, this is the yajna of creation, the
dynamics of existence and the paths of living in Dharma
with knowledge, action and worship together in yajna.
This yajna is for thee, they say. It is for Brihaspati, man
of knowledge, and Brahma, man of faith and vision, to
know and receive the highest gifts of yajna. Lord of
existence, save yajna by yajna, save yajnapati by yajna,
save me by yajna.

13. (Brihaspati Devata, Parameshthi Prajapati Rshi)

Tat जूतिर्जुषतामार्ज्यस्य बृहस्पर्तिर्यज्ञमिमं र्तनोत्वरिष्टं यज्ञ
समिमं र्दधातु | विश्वे देवार्सऽइह र्मादयन्तामोङम्प्रतिष्ठ॥१३॥

Mano jutirjusatamajyasya brhaspatiryajna-
mimam tanotvaristam yajnam samimam
dadhatu. Visve devasa’iha madayantamom
pratistha.

The mind is fast, instant in motion. May my mind
benefit from the offerings of yajna. May Brihaspati,
Lord of the wide world, expand the yajna of existence.
May the Lord sustain this yajna of ours in love and peace
without violence. May the powers of nature be ever fresh,
