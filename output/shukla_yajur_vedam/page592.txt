36. (Rasavidvidvan Devata, Devas Rshis)
ud: पृथिव्यां पयऽओर्षधीषु wat दिव्युन्तरिंक्षे wat धा: ।
पर्यस्वती: wast: सन्तु मर्ह्यम् uaa

Payah prthivyam paya’osadhisu payo divy-
antarikse payo dhah. Payasvatih pradisah santu
mahyam.

Agni, man of medicinal herbs and juices, take
on, hold on to, the juices and tonics in the earth, in the
herbs, in the regions of light and in the sky and study
them. And may all the worlds and directions of space
be full of juices and tonics for me too.

37. (Samrat Raja Devata, Devas Rshis)

भ्याम् । सरस्वत्यै वाचो यन्तुर्यन्त्रेणाग्ने: साम्रांज्येनाभि-
faserta ॥३७॥

Devasya tva savituh prasave’ Svinorbahubhyam
pusno hastabhyam. Sarasvatyai vaco yantur-
yantrenagneh samrajyenabhisincami.

In this socio-political yajna of the land in Lord
Savita’s creation, I in-vest you with the power and
presidency of Agni, the Ruler, and consecrate you with
the arms of Ashvinis (the heat and passion of the sun
and the peace and cool of the moon) and the hands of
Pusha (power of the nation’s sustenance with the
positive and negative current’s of the systemic circuit).
I vest in you the constitution of the sovereign nation
and sanctify you with the voice of the people in the
service of Sarasvati, the wisdom and culture of
humanity.
