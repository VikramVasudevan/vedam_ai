Agni, Lord of the earth and defender of the land,
observes truth, defends the truth, and abides in the truth.
His pleasure and joy is the herbs which grow and play
in the waters like water nymphs. May he protect and
promote our Brahma system of education and
knowledge, and our Kshatra system of defence and
administration. Homage to him in love and reverence.
All hail and care for the herbs and waters!

svaha.

Surrounded by lights and joining day and night,
that lord of universal peace and celebrated in all the
Sama hymns, the sun, is the lord sustainer of the earth.
His pleasure and joy is the rays of light which play and
exult in the sky joining and disjoining things in space.
May he protect and promote our Brahma system of light
