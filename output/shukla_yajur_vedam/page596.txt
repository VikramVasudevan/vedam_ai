CHAPTER -XVIII 563

Father and guardian of His children, lord maker
of the universe, universal Mind, Vishvakarma is the
sustainer of the earth and master of universal knowledge,
the Veda. Riks and Samans, Vedas, are the vibrations
of His omniscience ever on the move across space which
are the love and desire of the devotees. May He protect
and promote our Brahma system of education and
scientific yajna, and our Kshatra system of enlightened
and modern administration and defence. Homage and
libations to Him! Homage and libations for the divine
voice of the Veda!

Father guardian of your children, lord protector
of the world, all your homes and habitations up above,
and all your homes and householders down here, bless
them all. Bless our Brahma system of education and
enlightenment and our Kshatra system of administration
and employment with good homes and great peace and
joy. Homage and libations to the Lord!
