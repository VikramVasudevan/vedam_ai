mayobhurabhi ma vahi svaha. Maruto’si
marutam ganah sambhurmayobhurabhi ma vahi
svaha. Avasyurasi duvasvanchambhurmayo-
bhurabhi ma vahi svaha.

Prajapati, father and guardian of creation, vast
and deep as the ocean, oceans roll around in you. Lord
of spaces and spatial waters, showering the earth with
rain and the mind with virtue, you are peace yourself
and the giver of peace, bliss yourself and the giver of
bliss. Come and fold me into bliss all round.

Tempestuous lord of the winds, lord of the stormy
scholars of the world, you are goodness yourself and
the giver of universal good. You are prosperity and joy
yourself and the giver of universal joy and prosperity.
Come and fold me into the tempestuous storm of
knowledge and discovery all round.

You are the supreme lord of protection and
universal help. You are both lord and object of honour
and worship, peace and joy yourself and the giver of
joy and total freedom. Come and fold me into the bliss
of worship and acceptance all round.

Yaste’agne surye ruco divamatanvanti rasmi-

bhih. Tabhirno’ adya sarvabhi ruce janaya

Agni, lord of the universe, that beauty, light and

love of yours which shines in the sun and fills the

heavens and all other spaces of the world with its rays,
