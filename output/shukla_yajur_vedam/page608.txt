CHAPTER-XVIII 575

Vartrahatyaya Savase prtanasahyaya ca. Indra
tva’”’ vartayamasi.

Indra, lord of blazing power and prowess, for your
power to break down the anti-life clouds of darkness,
for the sake of strength and superiority in advancement,
and for your potential to rout the forces of the enemies
of humanity, we turn to you, abide by you and act under
your command.

69. (Indra Devata, Indra & Vishvamitra Rshis)

सहर्दानुम्पुरुहूत faerdugedits सम्पिणक कुर्णारुम् |
अभि qa वर्द्ध-मानं पिर्यारुमपार्दमिन्द्र तवसां जघन्थ ॥६९॥

Sahadanumpuruhiuta ksiyantamahastamindra
sampinak kunarum. Abhi vrtram vardhamanam
piyarumapdadamindra tavasa jaghantha.

Indra, lord of lightning power, disarm, wither and
crush the rival negative forces, lurking within,
mischievous, growing, vociferous, and like the cloud,
withholding the waters of progress. Indra, blazing with
the thunderbolt like the sun, break up the cloud and
destroy the mischief with your might.

Yo’ asman abhidasatyadharam gamaya tamah.

Indra, lord of might in command, eliminate the

battles of blood. Take them down to those who rise with

violent force and come upon us to fight. Whoever wish

to enslave us, take them down to utter darkness of
misery.
