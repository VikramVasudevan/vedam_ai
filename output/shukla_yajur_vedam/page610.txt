CHAPTER-XVIII 577

Agni, universal fire, Vaishvanara, omnipresent,
omnificent vitality, which blazes in heaven as the sun
is worth knowing. The fire in the earth is worth knowing.
The fire that has entered the entire herbs and trees of
the world is worth knowing by research. May this Agni
protect and sustain us against violence day and night.

Agni, lord defender, protector and sustainer,
under your umbrella, may we get the benefits we desire.
Lord of wealth and plenty, may we get the wealth and
the valorous heroes we need. Fighting the battles of life,
may we achieve the victories we prize. Lord ever young,
unageing, may we also share and achieve your
imperishable glory and majesty.
