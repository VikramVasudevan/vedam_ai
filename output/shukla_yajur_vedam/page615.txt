582 YAJURVEDA

O friend, ruler and administrator, those farmers
who produce grain and harvest the crop for strength
and sustenance, and those brilliant ones who,
accordingly, study, analyse and pronounce their
judgement on food production, for all these provide food
and maintenance.

Accepted and sanctified you are for the Ashvins,
earth and sunlight (for production), scientific
knowledge, strength and power and defence and
protection. This is your value and justification for life.
I consecrate you for splendour, power and prowess, and
solid strength.

Many are the things for you in this wide world.
They are different, each in its own place good for the
noble people. Don’t confuse one with the other in your
own understanding: “You are sura, intoxication. And
you are sura, stimulation for life’s energy. This is soma,
life’s energy, passion for action, peace and pleasure for
the mind. Coming to your own in your own place, don’t
violate soma, don’t injure me.”
