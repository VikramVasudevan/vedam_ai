584 YAJURVEDA

life, bless me with the spirit of challenge and the
ambition for victory.

10. (Soma Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

या caret ferdfercntet qeh a रक्षंति ।
vat र्पतत्तिणाशसिश्हश्सेमं पात्वश्हंस: ॥१०॥

Ya vyaghram visucikobhau vrkam ca ॥`ता<ऽता.
Syenam patatrinain sinham semam
patvainhasah.

That secret agency which watches and keeps off
both the tiger and wolf, the eagle and other birds of
prey, and the lion, the same may warn and protect this
ruler from sin and wrong-doing.

11. (Agni Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

र्भवाम्यरहंतौ पितरौ wat । सम्पूर्च ca सं at भद्रेणं Ss
विपृचं स्थ fa at पाप्मनां oS een

Yadapipesa mataram putrah pramudito dhayan.
Etattadagne’ anrno bhavamyahatau pitarau
maya. Samprca stha sam ma bhadrena prnkta
viprea stha vi ma papmana prnkta.

Agni, lord of light and yajna, when my child sucks
its mother with joy and hugs her almost crushing her
with love, then I feel free from my filial debt to nature
and my parents, since then are my parents saved through
me.

Stay one with the parents, with nature and with
God. Join me with piety and goodness. Stay away and
keep me away from sin and evil.
