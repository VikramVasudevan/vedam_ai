25. (Soma Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

अर्धऽऋचैरुक्थार्नाश्डैरूपं पदैराप्नोति निविर्द:।
प्रणवै: शस्त्रारणांश्रंरूपं eter सोर्मऽआप्यते ॥२७५॥

Ardha’rcairukthanam rupam padairapnoti
nividah. Pranavaih sastranam rupam payasa
soma apyate.

By half-Riks you get to the form and meaning of
Uktha verses. By phrases you get to the Nivids,
invocatory verses and formulae. By the chant and
worship of Om you get to the form and meaning of
mystic powers. By water and milk rejuvenation is
achieved as by soma.

26. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

वैश्वदेव: सररस्वत्या तृतीर्यमाप्तर सर्वनम् ura

Asvibhyam pratahsavanamindrenaindram
mddhyamdinam. Vaisvadevam sarasvatya
trftyamaptam savanam.

The morning Soma-yajna is performed with
hymns to the Ashvinis, the dawn, the sun and the moon.
The mid-day Soma-yajna is performed with hymns to
Indra for energy, power and honour. And the third,
evening Soma-yajna, is accomplished and completed
with hymns to Sarasvati, spirit and word of universal
knowledge and inspiration for the sake of universal
peace and happiness.
