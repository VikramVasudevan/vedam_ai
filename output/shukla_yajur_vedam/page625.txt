With the sacred Word and worship you get food
from the fields of earth. With sweet words and songs of
reverence one gets all the good wishes and success to
the heart’s desire. With a peaceful and generous mind
the husband gets the best conjugal relations with his
wife. And with the performance of yajna with the desired
Yajurvedic hymns, you come to the consummation of
settled life in a happy home.

30. (Yajna Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

व्रतेनं दीक्षामाप्नोति दीक्षयांऽप्नोति दक्षिंणाम् |
दक्षिणा श्रद्धार्माप्नोति श्रद्धयां सत्यर्माप्यते ॥३०॥

Daksina s‘raddhamapnoti Sraddhaya satya-
mapyate.

By the observance of discipline and celibacy, the
child comes to initiation and consecration into learning
and education. By learning and education, the young
man/woman comes to settlement, wealth and honour.
Settlement, wealth and honour begets faith. And through
faith one comes to attain the ultimate truth and values
of life and existence.
