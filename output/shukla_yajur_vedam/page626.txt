CHAPTER-XIX 593

Etavad rupam yajnasya yaddevairbrahmana
krtam. Tadetat sarvamapnoti yajne sautramani
sute.

This is the form of yajna with its meaning and
values which has been described and prescribed by God,
the Vedas and the Rishis. If a person is consecrated in a
Sautramani yajna, performed in honour of Indra, 1.e., in
the service of God and for the good of the world, with
the yajnopavita and the knots of dedication and
commitment of oneself in faith, he/she is blest with all
that and this, that is, in this life and hereafter.

32. (Indra Devata, Haimavarchi Rshi)

दर्धाना: a fafa देवर्तासु मदेमेन्द्रं यर्जमाना: स्वर्का:॥३२॥

Suravantam barhisadam suviram yajnain
hinvanti mahisa namobhih. Dadhanah somam
divi devatasu mademendram yajamanah
svarkah.

Great enlightened people, with rich libations of

havi, promote yajna, source of joy, operative in space
and maker of the brave.

Let us too, blest with enlightenment, holding
libations of soma for the divinities of heaven and earth,
performing yajna in honour of Indra, lord of the
universe, and ruler of the earth, rejoice with heavenly
bliss on earth.
