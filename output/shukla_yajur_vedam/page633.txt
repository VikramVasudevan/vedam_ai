600 YAJURVEDA

Dve srtt’asrnavam pitrnamaham devanamuta
martyanam. Tabhyamidam visvamejatsameti
yadantara pitaram mataram ca.

I have heard of two paths of the existential travel
of mortals, all that is born of father and mother between
earth and heaven: One, the path of the ancestors, and
the other, the path of the divines. By these two paths
does this world on the move moves on and on to its
destination.

48. (Agni Devata, Vaikhanasa Rshi)
Bax Ela: प्रजर्ननं मेऽअस्तु दर्शवीरश्सर्वगणशस्वस्तये ।

प्रजां agent में करोत्वन्नं पयो रेतोऽअ धत्त ॥४८॥

Idam havih prajananam me’astu daSavirain
sarvaganain svastaye. Atmasani prajdsani
pasusani lokasanyabhayasani. Agnih prajam
bahulam me karotvannam payo reto’asmasu
dhatta.

May this fertility of mine, the married life, be a
generative yajna, productive of ten brave children with
all the virtues for the well-being of society.

May this yajna and its production be the source
of spiritual enlightenment, progress of the people,
protection of animals, advancement of society and
creation of fearlessness.

Agni, lord of life and fertility, create for me lots
of noble children. Bless us with plenty of food, milk
and water, energy and generative vitality.
