May all our seniors, guardians of the nation, far
and near, old and new, high and low, and all those of
the middle rank, settled in peace, prosperity and power,
inspire us with passion and energy. May our parents
and seniors dedicated to truth and rectitude, far from
violence and exploitation, who raise the pranic energy
of life, guide and protect us in our battles of the world.

50. (Pitarah Devata, Shamkha Rshi)
अङ्गिरसो न: पितरो नर्वग्वाऽअर्थर्वाणो eta: सोम्यार्स:।
तेषो वयश्सुंमतौ यज्ञियांनामपिं ae सौमनसे स्यांम yon

Angiraso nah pitaro navagva’atharvano
bhrgavah somyasah. Tesam vayain sumatau
yajniyanamapi bhadre saumanase syama.

Our parents and seniors, guardians of the nation,
are seers and sages of the facts of holistic knowledge
and law, scholars of the latest sciences, and experts of
technology and engineering, all dedicated to universal
love, non-violence and spiritual values and settled in
mind for the peace and prosperity of mankind.

Let us concentrate and dedicate ourselves to their
wisdom, grace and excellence, and magnanimity and
benevolence, for the reason of their devotion to yajna
and their contribution to the progress of society.
