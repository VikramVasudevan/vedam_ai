ये न: पूर्वे` fart: areratsafet atladtet afetcer: 1
तेर्भिर्यम: GON हवीष्युशन्नुशद्भि: प्रतिकामर्मत्तु ॥५१॥

Ye nah purve pitarah somyaso’nuhire soma-
pitham vasisthah. Tebhiryamah samrarano
havinsyusannusadbhih pratikamamattu.

May our parents, seniors and ancestors, great
lovers of life and divinity, settled in peace and
prosperity, rich and generous at heart, come and join
our soma-yajna in person or in memory. With their
blessings and with their guidance may we, their children,
fair and just in conduct, loving the gifts of life and keen
to create happiness and share it with the community,
realize all our aims and ambitions in the world.

52. (Pitarah Devata, Shamkha Rshi)
rarely प्रचिंकितो मनीषा caisson नेषि पन्थाम् 1
तव प्रणीती पितरो नऽइन्दो देवेषु रर्त्मभजन्त धीररा:॥५२॥

Tvam soma pracikito manisa tvam rajisthamanu
nesi pantham. Tava praniti pitaro na indo devesu
ratnamabhajanta dhirah.

Soma, lord of light, peace and prosperity, spirit
of yajna, brilliant you are, wide-awake and responsive.
With your vision and wisdom, you lead us on by the
noblest and simplest paths of nature to divinity. Lord
of beauty and blessedness, inspired by your grace and
guidance only do our parents, seniors and guardians of
the community reach the coveted seats of joy and
celebrity among the noblest souls of the world.
