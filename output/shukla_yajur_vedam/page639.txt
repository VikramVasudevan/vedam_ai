606 YAJURVEDA

Agnisvattah pitara’ eha gacchata sadah sadah
sadata supranitayah. Atta havinsi prayatani
barhisyatha rayiin sarvaviram dadhatana.

Senior scholars and experts of the science of heat
and energy, men of justice and positive policy, come
here to us, seat yourselves in every home and every hall
of assembly, take the food and materials prepared with
care and offered with love and hope, and, sitting in your
laboratory and workshop, create the knowledge, impart
it to people, and produce the wealth which creates
versatile heroes for the nation and humanity.

Ye’ agnisvatta ye’anagnisvatta madhye divah
svadhaya madayante. Tebhyah svardada-
sunitimetam yathavasam tanvam kalpaydti.

Those seniors who are experts of the science and
technology of fire, and those who are not such but who
are experts of other fields of knowledge, and all those
who rejoice in the midst of the light of their own
knowledge itself: for all these, the self-luminous lord
of omniscience in-vests this body with health and energy
according to their need and desire.
