In the process of growth and regeneration, the
male organ of generation discharges the semen. Entering
the womb it discharges/releases the seed of life to plant
it into the mother’s body.

The foetus is covered with the placenta during
its growth till maturity. When the seed is born as an
independent soul in a new body-system, it abandons
the cover in which it had grown and matured. (Thus
elimination and regenerative growth through the natural
movement of discharge, elimination, union and
separation is part of life’s evolution under the universal
law of nature, which is Rtam, creative dynamics of Lord
Prajapati.)

By Rtam, the soul (jiva) gets Satyam, natural
existence of the body, Indriyam, organs of perception,
drinks and assimilation, purity and vitality for
regeneration, foods and growth, potentials for living and
continuation, and the immortal honey sweets of the joys
of existence for itself (jiva).
