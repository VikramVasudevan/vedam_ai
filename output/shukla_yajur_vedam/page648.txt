CHAPTER-XIX 615

Drstva rupe vyakarot satyanrte prajapatih.
Asraddhamanrte’ dadhacchraddham satye
prajapatih. Rtena satyamindriyam vipanam
Sukramandhasa indrasyendriyamidam payo’
mrtam madhu.

Having over-seen two aspects of created
Existence, Lord Prajapati analyses it into two forms:
One, reality, truth, dharma; the other, unreality, illusion,
adharma. Then Lord Prajapati places faith and
commitment (shraddha) in truth, and no-faith and no-
commitment (ashraddha) in untruth.

With truth and faith He joins right mind and
intelligence (rtambhara-buddhi) which is the Lord’s gift
of saving grace, protective, purifying, and enlightening
against the darkness of illusion. And this is the soul’s
real power and faculty which can lead to the honey
sweets and milky streams of immortality.

78. (Prajapati Devata, Shamkha Rshi)

विपार्नश्शुक्रर्मन्धसऽइन्द्रस्येन्द्रियमिदं पयोऽमृतं मर्धु ॥७८॥
Vedena rupe vyapibat sutasutau prajapatih.
Rtena satyamindriyam vipanam Sukram-
andhasa’indrasyendriyamidam payo’mrtam
madhu.

By Veda, Prajapati, the soul, comes to know both
forms of existence: Truth which is reality, dharma, Rtam,
and untruth which 1s illusion, adharma, anartam.

By Rtam it can realise the full potential of its
faculties and the immortality of its essential nature,
while with pure foods and drinks (in the interest of health
and meditation) it can experience here and now the
honey sweets and milky streams of nectar.
