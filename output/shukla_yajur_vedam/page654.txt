CHAPTER-XIX 621

and the health and spirits of the man, create a happy
home with the head and mouth of both together in truth
with a sweet tongue fluent in purity. The purity, comfort
and security of the home, the love and desire of the
woman’s fertility, the passion and power of the man’s
virility, and the child as bloom of the health and love of
the union, all these keep the family together.

89. (Ashvinau Devate, Shamkha Rshi)

अश्विभ्यां चरक्षुरमृतं ग्ररहाभ्यां छार्गेन तेर्जो हविषां श्रृतेर्न ।

पक्ष्माणि गोधूमै: कुर्वलैरुतानि ust न शुक्रम्सितं
वसाते ॥८९॥

Asvibhyam caksuramrtam grahabhyam chagena
tejo havisa Srtena. Paksmani godhumaih
kuvalairutani peso na sukramasitam vasdate.

By the Ashvinis, sun and moon, with portions of
clear soma distilled, is created the immortal light of the
eye. With tonics prepared with goat’s milk is created
the lustre of health. The lower and upper eyelashes are
created with wheat and water lilies, and the beauteous
form white as well as dark shines with the same nature’s
gifts.

90. (Sarasvati Devata, Shamkha Rshi)
अविर्न मेषो नसि diate प्राणस्य पनन्थाऽअमृतो ग्रहांभ्याम्।
सरस्वत्युपवाकैर्व्यनं नस्यानि ASAI ॥९०॥

Avirna meso nasi viryaya pranasya pantha’
amrto grahabhyam. Sarasvatyupavakairvyanam
nasyani barhirbadarairjajana.

Like the sheep and the ram, the protector and
contender, the Ashvinis, with portions of clear soma,
