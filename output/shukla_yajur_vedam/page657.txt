95. (Ashvinau Devate, Shamkha Rshi)

सोमऽइन्दु: ॥९५॥

Tejah pasunain havirindriyavat parisruta payasa
saragham madhu. ASvibhyam dugdham bhisaja
sarasvatya sutasutabhyamamrtah soma’ induh.

The healthy glow of living forms, the mighty rich
nourishments of life, the delicious honey collected by
the bee from juices all round are the nectar, the vital
power, the beauty distilled from the original as well as
the refined sources of nature by Sarasvati, mother spirit
of life and humanity through the Ashvinis, creative and
healing powers of nature’s cosmic flow.
