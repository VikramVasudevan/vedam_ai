CHAPTER-IT 33

nourishment, for preservation and protection, for
destruction of the destroyers.

(ii) Who gives you away/up? He gives you away/
up. For what purpose/to what end? For self-realization/
self-negation. For nourishment: you are the share of the
good and the protectors; even of the wicked and the
destroyers, but, for their punishment and destruction.

May Lord Tvashta, eternal maker and generous
giver, bless us with lustre of character and light of
knowledge, food for body, mind and senses, peace and
nobility of mind, good and glowing health of body. May
the Lord grant us all kinds of wealth and stability. May
He complete and perfect whatever is wanted in our body
and mind and refine us with culture and virtue.

Let us advance with holy light and lustre, honey-
sweets of food and blooming health, and a mind at peace
with noble aspirations, and attain all round prosperity.
And may Tvashta, Eternal Maker and generous giver,
complete what is lacking in our life and refine us to a
state of perfection.
