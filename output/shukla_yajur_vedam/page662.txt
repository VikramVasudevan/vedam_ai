Accepted, appointed and consecrated in this
divinely protected Order of the brilliant State of the
World: I dedicate and commit myself to the Order, in
the Order, for the Order. I dedicate and commit myself
to the State, in the State, for the State, to the people,
among the People, for the People. I dedicate myself to
the horses and cows. I dedicate myself to all parts of
the Order and the State. Firmly established in my mind
and soul, with all my soul and pranic energy, I dedicate
myself to the living spirit and exuberant dynamics of
the human nation. I dedicate myself to the growth and
development of the strength and prosperity of the
people. In the light of heaven and greenery of the earth
and her environment, I dedicate myself to heaven and
earth. I dedicate and commit myself to the grand socio-
economic yajna of service, governance and brilliance
of a generous humanity for total and holistic
development.
