पुरोहिता देवस्यं सवितु: wa । देवा देवैरवन्तु मा eeu

Traya deva ekadaSa trayastriinsah suradhasah.
Brhaspatipurohita devasya savituh save. Deva
devairavantu ma.

Three are the orders of divinities, brilliant powers

thirtythree powers of grandeur and majesty all,

me and promote me for the higher life.

earth, water, fire, air, space, sun, moon and the stars.

ii. Eleven Rudras, viz., five primary pranic
energies (prana, apana, vyana, udana and samana), five
secondary pranic energies (naga, kurma, krikala

iii. Twelve Adityas, viz., twelve months of the
year, they being zodiacs of the sun in the year. They are
Adityas because they count up the time and exhaust the
life of whatever is born. In addition to these (8+11+12),
there is Indra, universal electric energy, and Yajna,
