634 YAJURVEDA

Prana, life, is precious and sacred. The cow is
precious and sacred, inviolable. Varuna, Lord Supreme,
the eminent sage, is great. If ever we injure, violate or
revile these, then, O Varuna, O generous sage, deliver
us from that sin.

Noble sage of knowledge, you are initiated and
consecrated, blessed, calm and generous as a fountain.
Ward off the sins committed by the nobles, through/by
the nobles. Let the ordinary people fight out and
eliminate the crimes committed by the average people.
Save us from fear, terror and violence.

19. (Apah Devta, Prajapati Rshi)

Soma, disciple, your heart and soul is in sea, in
the midst of the energy there and in the depths of
celestial waters. May the pranic energies and the vitality
of the herbs enter your mind with their secrets. May the
herbs and the pranic energies be friendly to us. They
will be unfriendly to those negativities which harm us
and which we, in consequence, hate and avoid.
