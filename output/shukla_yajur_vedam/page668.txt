CHAPTER-XX 635

Drupadadiva mumucanah svinnah snato
maladiva. Putam pavitrenevajyamapah
Sundhantu mainasah.

Like a prisoner freed from a post of captivity,
like a man in sweat cleansed of dirt after bath, like ghee
purified of scum through a strainer, may the waters and
energies purge me of sin and evil into the purity of
freedom.

21. (Surya Devata, Praskanva Rshi)
sga तर्मसस्परि eq; प्श्यन्तऽउत्तरम् |
aa देवत्रा सूर्यमर्गन्म ज्योर्तिरुत्तमम् ॥२१॥

Udvayam tamasaspari svah pasyanta’uttaram.
Devam devatra suryamaganma jyotiruttamam.

Up we move beyond the dark with a vision of the
higher regions of bliss, and may we reach the sun, the
Lord of Light Supreme, among the lights of the world.

22. (Agni Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

saisstarcarkate सर्मसृक्ष्महि । पर्यस्वानग्नऽआर्गमं
तं मा ade ata प्रजयां च धर्नेन च ॥२२॥

Apo’adyanvacarisam rasena samasrksmahi.
Payasvanagna’agamam tam ma sam srja
varcasa prajaya ca dhanena ca.

I have tasted the waters of bliss to-day. Let us all
create joy and open out to the flood gates of freedom
and bliss.

Agni, having drunk of joy and bliss, I have come
to you. Lord of light and knowledge, bless me with
children, wealth of knowledge and prosperity and the
splendour of honour and dignity.
