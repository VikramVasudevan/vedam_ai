Samit, food of the holy fire, you are the harbinger

of the light divine, light itself. Infuse light and lustre
into me. May the earth be generous. May the dawns
bring us light and peace. May the sun give light and
warmth. May this whole world be full of joy. May I
shine with the light of the world and be the light itself.
May | attain my desire and great ambitions. May I, with
truth of word and deed, attain the glory of the world.

Agni, lord keeper and sustainer of the vows of
speech and karma, initiated and consecrated I place the
fuel into the holy fire with concentration and dedication
of mind. I light the fire and commit myself to the vows
of yajna and faith in the divine order.
