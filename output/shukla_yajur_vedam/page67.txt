Vishnu, yajna, performed with the ecstatic chant
of jagati verses, reached the regions of the sun, and from
there eliminated all that opposes us and all that we
oppose for the sake of life. Vishnu, yajna, performed
with the spontaneous chant of trishtubh verses, rose up
to the middle regions of the sky, and from there
eliminated all that opposes us and all that we oppose
for the sake of life. Vishnu, yajna, performed with the
joyous chant of gayatri verses, went over the earth, and
from there eliminated all that opposes us and all that
we oppose for the sake of life. Feeding on the gifts of
nature purified by yajna, let us rejoice, and in the service
of the balance and harmony of life and existence, let us
rise to the heights of heaven and we’ll be one with the
light of knowledge and Dharma.
