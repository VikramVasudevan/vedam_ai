Lord of the universe, self-existent, self-refulgent,
greatest of all, giver of light and honour, give me light
and honour. I follow the path of the sun in orbit, the
path of Dharma revealed by you.

27. (Agni Devata, Vamadeva Rshi)
अग्ने गृहपते सुगृहपतिस्त्वर्याऽग्नेऽहं गृहर्पतिना yaras-
गार्ह-पत्यानि सन्तु Bate: सूर्यस्याव्रतमन्वार्वर्ते ॥२७॥

grhapatina bhuyadsam sugrhapatistvam
maya’gne grhapatina bhuyah. Asthuri nau

manvavarte.

Agni, Lord of the House of Existence, Master of
knowledge and the fire of yajna, great as you are as the
keeper and sustainer of the world, so may I too, with
you as the ideal, be a good and efficient house holder.
And you too, over me, head of this family, be the
protector and sustainer of this household. May we two,
husband and wife, together perform the duties of the
home for a good hundred years. May I follow the path
of life like the sun in orbit, the path of Dharma revealed
by you.
