650 YAJURVEDA

Evedindram vrsanam vajrabahum vasisthaso
abhyarcantyarkaih. Sa na stuto viravaddhatu
gomad yuyam pata svastibhih sada nah.

The best, richest and most excellent people, well
settled in peace and prosperity, honour and worship with
prayers and good works Indra, lord of might and
majesty, ruler of the land and the world, hero of the
arms of steel. Honoured and worshipped thus, may he
hold and protect our land and nation blest with heroic
warriors and the wealth of cows, fields and pastures.

55. (Ashvi-Sarasvati-Indra Devata, Vidarbhi Rshi)
सर्मिद्धोऽअग्निरंश्विना तप्तो Tat विराट् सुत:।
ge धेनु: सरस्वती arts शुक्रमिहेन्द्रियम् ॥७७५॥

Samiddho’ agnirasvina tapto gharmo virdat
sutah. Duhe dhenuh sarasvati somain sukrami-
hendriyam.

Agni, lighted, heated, burning and blazing as
universal and sovereign light of the world, inspired with
vitality, creates food and energy for the Lord’s creation.

Sarasvati, voice of universal knowledge, holds
the pure nectar of the wealth and grandeur of the spirit
of life and, like a cow, yields it for the nourishment and
benefit of men and women of the world.

So must I create light and vitality. So should all
men and women do like the Ashvinis, powers of health
and nourishment.

56. (Ashvi-Sarasvati-Indra Devata, Vidarbhi Rshi)
तनूपा fast सुतेऽश्विनोभा सरस्वती |
मध्वा रर्जाश्ऽसीन्द्रियमिन्द्राय पथिर्भिर्वहान् ॥७६॥
