offers of berries, barley and shoots of corn in all sincerity
of word and deed. And the generous scholar, Sarasvati,
mother of life and intelligence, the physician, like a

drinks and milk, soma distilled from herbal essences,
nectar-like waters and butter and honey would follow.

Man of yajna, perform the yajna with the best of
ghrta and fragrant offerings.

Hota yaksadidedita’ ajuhvanah sarasvati-
mindram balena vardhayannrsabhena gave-
ndriyamasvinendraya bhesajam yavaih
karkandhubhirmadhu lajairna masaram payah
somah parisruta ghrtam madhu vyantvajyasya
hotaryaja.

Inspired by grace, called by the sacred voice, let
the man of yajna perform the yajna in honour of Sarasvati,
divine intelligence, Indra, universal glory, and Ashvinis,
nature’s powers of health and growth, with libations of
barley, excellent berries as well as puffed rice. He would
thus be strengthening, refining and promoting food,
medicines and life’s beauty for the soul with the aid of
medicinal plants and cow’s milk. And then milk and
delicious drinks, soma distilled from herbal juices, ghee
and honey would follow.
