37. (Ashvinis & Others Devata, Svastyatreya Rshi)

eat यक्षत्तिस्त्रो देवीर्न test त्रर्यस्तिधार्तवोऽपसो maf
`हिरण्यर्यमङ्विनेडा न भारती ara ateadt महऽइन्द्राय
दुहऽ इन्द्रियं wa: सोर्म: uta ad मधु व्यन्त्वार्ज्यस्य
होतर्यर्ज ॥३७॥

Hota yaksattisro devirna bhesajam trayastri-
dhatavo ’ paso rupamindre hiranyayamasvineda
na bharati vaca sarasvati maha’ indraya duha
indriyam payah somah parisruta ghrtam madhu
vyantvajyasya hotaryaj.

Let the man of yajna perform the yajna, invoking
three divine powers, Ida, eternal speech and intelligence,
Sarasvati, fluent speech, and Bharati, specific intelligence,
and let him pray to the Ashvinis, sanative powers of
nature, for curative waters of health and longevity
(bheshajam). The three as well as the Ashvinis would
create threefold balance of health (with sattva, rajas and
tamas — intellect, energy and matter — and three humors
of vata, pitta, and cough), turn it into a golden form and
vest it into Indra, the soul. Thus do the Ashvinis as well
as Ida, Sarasvati and Bharati, with speech and energy,
create glory and prosperity from nature for the soul.

Man of yajna, perform the yajna with ghee, and
then milk and delicious drinks, soma distilled from juices,
nectars of water and ghee and honey would follow and
flow upon the earth.
