Be masters of your own wealth and power and
manage it well with justice and in virtue. Offer liberal
hospitality with love and reverence to the senior
benefactors of society, men of knowledge, experience
and wisdom. Offer them delicious drinks of water and
nourishing juices, health giving milk and ghee,
sumptuous foods and honey-sweet fruits to their
satisfaction.
