if with the wealth of goats, sheep, bulls and cows.
Honoured and consecrated they are with shoots of
grasses, ears of corn and roasted rice as with children.
Inspired they are, seasoned and purified with holy food
and nectar-drinks of life. And up-front they are, on their
mark, ready for self-sacrifice in the service of humanity.

Exhort them, all of you, support them with love
and loyalty, and may you and the Ashvinis, Sarasvati
and the protector Indra make the best of their service
and sacrifice. Replete they are with honey-mead,
overflowing, streaming for anyone to taste. May all
drink of the soothing and enlightening sweets, may all
rejoice and prosper with the wealth of life.

Relent not, man of yajna, carry on with the offers
of libations.
