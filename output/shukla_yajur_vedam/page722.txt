CHAPTER-XXI 689

Let the man of yajna perform the yajna in honour
of Ashvinis, prana and apana powers of nature and the
physicians with the milk and ghee of the goat. Let the
Ashvinis partake of the holy food. Let them eat and
raise the pranic vitality from the middle part of the body,
for sure, before the anti-system forces of ailments take
hold of the body and make their home there. And may
the Ashvinis delight in protecting and promoting the
subtle vitality of the pranas which are ever active in the
digestion of food, first in assimilating the assimilable
and eliminating the waste, exhilarating, creating a
hundred currents of energy, living heat of the system,
and essential strength of the body free from obesity.
May the Ashvinis protect and promote the vitality
expressive from the sides, the back, hyperactive vital
parts, weaker and delicate parts, in short, from every
vital part of the body system.

Man of yajna, offer the holy food in the yajna.
