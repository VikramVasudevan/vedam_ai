utsadato’ngadangadavattanam karadevam
sarasvati jusatam havirhotaryaja.

Let the man of yajna perform the yajna in honour
of Sarasvati, divine voice and mother power of
enlightenment, with the holy food of sheep’s milk and
ghee. May Sarasvati partake of the holy food offered in
yajna and raise the pranic vitality from the middle of
body before the anti-system forces of ailments take hold
of the body and make their home there. And may mother
Sarasvati delight in protecting and promoting the subtle
vitality of the pranas which are ever active in the
digestion of food, first in assimilating the assimilable
and throwing out the waste, exhilarating, creating a
hundred forms of energy, vital fire of the system,
essential strength of the body free from obesity. May
Sarasvati protect and promote the vitality expressive
and perceptible from the sides, the back, hyperactive
vital parts, weaker and delicate parts, in short, from
every vital part of the body system.

Man of yajna, offer the holy food of yajna to the
mother.
