CHAPTER-XXI 691

thamanam sumatksaranam satarudriyana-
magnisvattanam pivopavasananam parsvatah
Sronitah sitamata utsadato’ngadangdada-
vattanam karadevamindro jusatam havir-
hotaryaja.

Let the man of yajna perform the yajna in honour
of Indra, wonder and glory of the power of nature and
the nation, with the most powerful holy foods of the
strength of the bull and the rishabha plant. May Indra
partake of the food and raise the pranic vitality of the
body-system from the middle of the body, for sure,
before the anti-system forces of ailments take hold of
the body and make their home there. And may Indra
delight in protecting and promoting the subtle vitality
of the pranas which are ever active in the digestion of
food, first in assimilating the assimilable and eliminating
the waste, exhilarating, creating a hundred forms of
energy, vital fire of the system, and essential strength
of the body free from obesity. May Indra protect and
promote the vitality expressed and perceptible from the
sides, the back, hyperactive parts, weaker and delicate
parts, in short, from every vital part of the body system.

Man of yajna, offer the holy food of yajna for
Indra.
