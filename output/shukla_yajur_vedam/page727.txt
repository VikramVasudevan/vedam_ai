foods.

It leads to the favourite haunts of Sarasvati,
wisdom, and the sheep and holy foods.

It leads to the favourite resorts of Indra (majesty),
and the bull (power) and holy foods.

It leads to the favourite haunts of Agni (energy),

to the favourite haunts of Indra, the protector, to the
favourite haunts of Savita (inspiration), to the favourite
haunts of Varuna (water), to the favourite haunts of the
trees and their fruits, to the favourite places of the noble
people of piety and protection of the sacred resources,
it leads to the favourite homes of Agni, lord of cosmic
yajna, it leads to its own grandeur, it creates the means
of its own yajnic sacrifice and all the food and energy
for life.

May the glorious Agni, omniscient light of life,
lead all projects of yajna to success.

Man of yajna, keep on with the yajna, don’t relent.
