CHAPTER-XXI 699

May all the divine powers come and make the
energy and wealth of the world flow into the blessed
man of yajna.

Blessed man, perform the yajna, never relent.

55. (Ashvinis & Others Devata, Svastyatreya Rshi)

देवऽइन्द्रो Tieden: ataeanvarattiaa रर्थ:।
tat न रूपममृर्ते जनित्रमिन्द्राय त्वष्टा दर्धदिन्द्रियाणिं
वसुवने वसुधेर्यस्य व्यन्तु यज ॥५५॥

Deva’indro narasamsastrivarithah sarasvaty-
asvibhyamiyate rathah. Reto na rupamamrtam
janitramindraya tvasta dadhadindriyani
vasuvane vasudheyasya vyantu yaja.

The brilliant Indra universally sung and
celebrated, residing in the three worlds of heaven, earth
and the sky, wondrous warrior of the chariot, is reached
through Sarasvati, divine speech and the Ashvinis,
circuitous powers of nature. Tvashta, divine maker of
forms, creates the vital creative energy as well as the
immortal form, senses and the sense organs for Indra
and vests these in him. May Tvashta, Sarasvati and the
Ashvinis create the wealth of the world for Indra, blessed
man of honour and power, and vest the same in him.

Man of yajna, perform the yajna in honour of the
divinities.

56. (Ashvinis & Others Devata, Svastyatreya Rshi)
