Agni, universal energy of life and the world, you
are immence and abundant as mother like the earth, pre-
eminent and super-guardian as father like the sky. You
attain to everything; self-impelled you impel everything;
you are constant ever, and ever on the move; you are
ever at peace and ever fresh; you reach everywhere;
you are the way to love and honour; you are fast and
impetuous; you are generous like a shower; kind,
reaching everyone’s heart. Surely, you are the way to
final beatitude and worthy of meditation. Ever new as
reborn, you make the time fly with the motion of the
stars. Come and be with us here.

Guardians of the earth in all directions, serve and
save this consecrated power for the noble people and the
environment in the interest of national growth. Here is
peace and pleasure, let it stay while you enjoy. Here is
stability and constancy. Here is self-dependence and self-
realisation.
