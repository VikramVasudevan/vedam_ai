CHAPTER-XXII 725

and be dedicated, may the mind grow by yajna and yoga
and be dedicated, may the soul grow by yajna and yoga
and be dedicated to the lord of life and existence, may
the knowledge of Veda and the man of knowledge grow
by yajna and meditation and be dedicated, may the light
of knowledge and the spirit grow by yajna and be
dedicated to divine service, may the heavenly joy of
the soul grow by yajna and be dedicated to the Divine,
may the ultimate question and desire of the soul be
answered and fulfilled by yajna and divine grace and
be surrendered to the Divine. May the yajna of life and
age grow to completion by constant yajna and
meditation and terminate in the interminable and infinite
divine super-existence, which is the last oblation of
existential yajna.

34. (Yajna Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

एर्कस्मै स्वाहा द्वाभ्याश्ठंस्वाहां शताय स्वाद्दैर्कशताय स्वाहा
व्युष्ट्यै स्वाहां स्वर्गाय स्वार्हा ॥३४॥

Ekasmai svaha dvabhyam svaha Sataya svahai-
kasataya svaha vyustyai svaha svargaya svaha.

By yajna in truth of thought, word and deed,
homage and surrender to the One, Supreme Soul of the
universe. Homage to the two, Purusha, the supreme spirit,
and Prakriti, one the efficient cause and the other the
material cause of the world. Homage to the hundred (years
of life and countless things). Homage to the hundred
(years of life) and the one beyond. Homage to the fire,
the reckoning and the dawn. Homage to Svarga, the joy
of the next world.
