महिमा तेऽन्येन न सन्नर्शो eau

Svayam vajinstanvam kalpayasva svayam
yajasva svayam jusava. Mahima te’nyena na
sannase.

Man of knowledge, seeker of advancement,
develop your self by yourself. Do the yajna of joint work
by your own choice. Serve the scholars and society by
yourself. Your eminence and value must not be destroyed
by others.

16. (Savita Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

Na va’u’etanmriyase na risyasi devan’idesi
pathibhih sugebhih. Yatrasate sukrto yatra te
yayustatra tva devah savita dadhatu.

Man of knowledge and yajna, you go to meet with
the seers and sages by the straight and right paths of
truth. Die you shall not, nor your value diminish.

Where dwell the men of right action and where
they realize lasting peace and joy, there may Savita,
lord of light and life, establish you.
