and acts of love and wisdom.

37. (Women Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

रजता हरिंणी: सीसा ast ara कर्मभि: ।
अर्श्वस्य वाजिर्नस्त्वचि सिर्मा: शम्यन्तु शार्म्यन्ती:।३७॥

Rajata harinth sisa yujo yujyante karmabhih.
Asvasya vajinastvaci simah Samyantu
Samyantih.

Women in love, lovely, captivating, arresting with
love and loyalty, exciting and dedicated, are joined in
marriage to the protection and embrace of handsome,
virile and generous young men by their own will and
action. Bound in the discipline of matrimony, may they
be at peace in security, and may they provide for the
love, peace and security of the young men of their choice.

38. (Sabhasad Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

क्रृणुहि भोर्जनानि ये बर्हिषो adsstea यर्जन्ति ॥३८॥

Kuvidanga yavamanto yavancidyatha dantyanu-
purvam viyuya. Thehaisam krnuhi bhojanani ye
barhiso nama’ uktim yajanti.

Dear Sabhasad, eminent member of the council,
just as farmers blest with rich barley harvest the grain
with discrimination, some plants separately and some
together, so do the teachers sit on seats of grass, receive
food and water, and carry on the yajna of education
accomplishing their work with the disciples with
judgement. Here in this school, provide for their food
and maintenance.
