752 YAJURVEDA

Vedahamasya bhuvanasya nabhim veda
dyavaprthivi’antariksam. Veda suryasya brhato
jJanitramatho veda candramasam yatojah.

I know the centre-hold of this world. I know the
heaven and earth and the middle regions of the sky. I
know the great creator of the sun. I know the moon and
wherefrom it was born. (The man of real knowledge is
one who knows Brahma, creator and sustainer of the
world, and the world itself, who knows the efficient cause,
Brahma, and the material cause, Prakriti, and the
beneficiary, the jiva. The speaker is such a man of
knowledge. Alternatively, the speaker is Brahma Itself.)

61. (Prashta Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

पृच्छामिं त्वा aed पृथिव्या: पृच्छामि wa भुर्वनस्य

Prcchami tva paramantam prthivyah prcechami
yatra bhuvanasya nabhih. Prcechami tva vrsno’
asvasya retah prcchami vacah paramam vyoma.
Task you: What is the highest end of the earth and
where? I ask you: What and where is the centre of the
world? I ask you: Where and what is the seed of the
virility and fertility of the male? I ask you: What and
where is the haven and home and ultimate preserve of
the Word, universal speech?
