CHAPTER-XXIII 753

Iyam vedih paro’antah prthivya’ayam yajno
bhuvansya nabhih. Ayain somo vrsno’asvasya
reto brahmayam vacah paramam vyoma.

This yajna-vedi is the supreme and ultimate end
of the earth. This yajna is the centre and centre-hold of
the world. This soma is the seed and source of the virility
and fertility of the male. And Brahma is the haven and
home and birth and preserve of the Word, divine speech.

Subhiuh svayambhuh prathamo ’ntarmaha-
tyarnave. Dadhe ha garbhamrtviyam yato jatah
prajapatih.

Gracious and glorious, self-existent and at the very
centre in this grand ocean of the universe is Brahma. He
plants the seed of creation into Prakriti according to the
season of the creative cycle, and thence is born Prajapati,
the sun, lord of life.

wan पिर्बतु सोमर होतर्यर्जं ॥६४॥

Hota yaksatprajapatim somasya mahimnah.
Jusatam pibatu somam hotaryaja.

The man of yajna performs the yajna in honour of
Prajapati, father and sustainer of the world of creation
by the grace and glory of Soma, lord of life and
omnipotence. May he ever dedicate himself to the lord
