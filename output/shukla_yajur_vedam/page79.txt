cherished kind as it is, scholars of the science of heat
and energy should maintain and continue through their
disciples the tradition of research and development of
this wonderful and versatile power in laboratories and
institutions in every country for every community.

Asya pratnamanu dyutam sukram duduhre’

The Rishis and scholars dedicated to the study of
the heat and light of agni in yajna have discovered and
received the purest showers of the waters of life from
this timeless source-power of a thousand gifts of
achievement (just as you tend and milk the mother cow
and receive the gift of the purest nourishment for life).

17. (Agni Devata, Avatsara Rshi)

AASSTAU ॥१७॥

Tanupa’ agne’si tanvam me pahyayurda’agne’-
syayurme dehi varcoda’ agne’si varco me dehi.
Agne yanme tanva’ unam tanma’ aprna.

Agni, you are protector of the body with health
and nourishment. Protect my body. You are the giver of
life. Give me full life. You are the giver of lustre and
glory. Give me lustre and glory. Whatever is short and
wanting in me, that, I pray, fulfil and complete and
perfect.
