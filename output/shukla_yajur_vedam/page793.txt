760 YAJURVEDA

bullocks are of the nature of Agni and Soma, and of

Agni and Vishnu. The barren cow is of the nature of

Mitra and Varuna, pranic energy. The rest anywhere are

of friendly nature, wherever they are and wherever they

go.

9. (Agni & Others Devata, Prajapati Rshi)
कृष्णग्रीवाऽआग्नेया ave: सौम्या: yaar वायव्याऽअर्वि-
ज्ञाताऽअर्दित्यै सरूंपा धात्रे deadat Sarai पत्नींभ्य:॥९॥

Krsnagriva’agneya babhravah saumyah sveta
vayavya’avijnata’adityai sarupa dhatre
vatsataryo devanam patnibhyah.

The black-necked animals are fiery, the brown
ones are cool and gentle as soma, the white ones are
airy. The unknown are for the earth, those of like form
for the Protector, the young calves for the wives of the
divines and for the sun-rays to foster.

10. (Antariksha etc. Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

yor भौमा yarsssidkent agext दिव्या: wract
वैद्युता: सिध्मास्तारका: ॥१०॥

Krsna bhauma dhumra’antariksa brhanto
divyah sabala vaidyutah sidhmastarakah.

The black ones, the farming animals, are for the
earth. The brown ones are for the sky. The big,
wonderful, whitish are live wires like electricity. The
gentle ones are for the alleviation of suffering.

11. (Vasanta etc. Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

धूम्रान् aedactd vad ग्रीष्मार्य कृष्णान् aatsts—
रुणाञ्छरदे eat हेमन्तार्यं पिशङ्गाञ्छिर्शिराय ॥११॥
