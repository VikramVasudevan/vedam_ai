Smoky grey and dark brown animals are for kind
and loving soma-natured parents and seniors. Brown and
smoky dark are for the senior councillors. Black and
brown are for those seniors who are experts of the science
of fire. And black and spotted are for those who have
three-fold responsibilities. (Honour the seniors with pet-
gifts and protect the animals for them.)

moving around, dedicated to the plough and the share,

sustaining as the air, bright as the sunlight. They have
the elements and virtues of the air and the sun.
