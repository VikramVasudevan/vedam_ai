CHAPTER-XXIV 773

Khadgo vaisvadevah sva krsnah karno
gardabhastaraksuste raksasamindraya sukarah
simho marutah krkalasah pippaka Sakuniste
Saravyayai visvesam devanam prsatah.

The rhino is for Vishvedevas; black dog, long-
eared ass, the tiger, these are for the demons; the boar
is for the king; the lion is for the winds; the chameleon,
pippaka and the vulture are for the marksman; the
spotted deer is favourite of the noblest persons.
