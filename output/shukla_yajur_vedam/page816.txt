CHAPTER-XXV 783

long before the world was born. He it is who holds this
earth and Heaven. To Him we offer our homage and
worship in libations of praise in words and deeds in
truth.

11. (Ishvara Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

a: प्रांणतो र्निमिषतो र्महित्वैकऽइद्राजा जर्गतो बभूर्व ।
य gsisarea द्विपदश्चर्तुष्पद: welt card हविर्षा
विधेम eeu

Yah pranato nimisato mahitvaika ’idraja jagato
babhuva. Ya ise’asya dvipadascatuspadah
kasmai devaya havisa vidhema.

It is He who was and is the sole lord of the living,
breathing and moving world of the eye (and ear). It is
He who, by His own might, rules over the world of the
humans and the animals. To that same lord of power
and bliss we offer our homage and worship in libations
of praise and fragrant havi in truth of word and deed.

12. (Ishvara Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

यस्येमे हिमर्वन्तो महित्वा यरस्य समुद्रश्रसयां सहाहु:। यस्येमा:
प्रदिशो aet ae कस्मै cart हविरषां विधेम ॥१२॥

Yasyeme himavanto mahitva yasya samudram
rasaya sahahuh. Yasyemah pradiso yasya bahu
kasmai devaya havisa vidhema.

By whose might, they say, these snow-covered
mountains have come into existence and the oceans roll
with floods of water, and who by His arms of
omnipotence wields these quarters of space, to Him we
offer our homage and worship with oblations of praise
and havi.
