CHAPTER-XXV 785

Devanam bhadra sumatirrjuyatam devanam
ratirabhi no nivarttatam. Devanam sakhya-
mupasedima vayam deva na’ayuh pratirantu
jivase.

May the auspicious wisdom of brilliant visionaries
come to us. May the wealth and knowledge of simple,
sincere and generous people come to us from all sides.
May we enjoy the favour and friendship of noble and
dedicated people of faith and excellence. And may all
these nobilities thrive and promote our life for good and
joyous living.

Those we invoke and honour in yajna with the
ancient, eternal and self-proclaimed voice of the Veda:
Bhaga, giver of glory, Mitra, universal friend, Aditi,
mother of indestructible wisdom, Daksha, lord versatile
and inviolable, Aryama, sustainer of creation, Varuna,
best and highest, Soma, giver of peace, prosperity,
knowledge and happiness, Ashvinis, givers of health
and well-being, and all the teachers and scholars of the
world.

May mother Sarasvati, benevolent and beatific,
give us all the good and gracious gifts of life.
