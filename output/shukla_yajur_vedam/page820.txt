CHAPTER-XXV 787
19. (Ishvara Devata, Gotama Rshi)

स्वस्ति aseat वृद्धर्शवा: स्वस्ति 4: Gur विश्वर्वेदा: ।
स्वस्ति नस्ताक्ष्योऽअरिष्टनेमि: स्वस्ति नो बृहस्पर्ति-
aad ॥१९॥

Svasti na’indro vrddhasravah svasti nah pusa
visvavedah. Svasti nastarksyo’aristanemih svasti
no brhaspatirdadhatu.

May Indra, great is His glory, be kind and grant
us honour and greatness. May Pusha, lord sustainer and
wielder of universal wealth, be generous and bring us
health and wealth. May the inviolable lord of speed and
security be watchful and grant us progress and freedom.
And may Brihaspati, lord of the great world of existence,
be gracious and bless us with all the good and well-
being in life.

20. (Vidvans Devata, Gotama Rshi)
अग्निजिह्वा मर्नव: सूरंचक्षसो विश्वे नो देवाऽअवसा-
THATS IR ott

Prsadasva marutah prsnimatarah subham ya-
vano vidathesu jagmayah. Agnijihva manavah
suracaksaso visve no deva’avasagamanniha.

Great are the scholars, vibrant as the winds and
brilliant as children of sunbeams. Riding on flying
horses, they are ever on the move to goodness and glory
in the battles of life.

Fiery is their tongue and blazing are their eyes,
and yet they are human, dedicated to thought and
reflection.
