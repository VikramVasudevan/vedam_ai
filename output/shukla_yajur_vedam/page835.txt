802 YAJURVEDA

Seven are the conjunctions between oceans,
waters, sun, heaven, air, sky, heat and earth, which hold
the world. The eighth, mother earth, sustains the forms
of life. May all the conjunctions and the sustaining
mother’s lap help us realise our aims of life.

O ruler, act well so that our aims of life be fulfilled
and the paths of life be straight and clear.

By dedication to the other side, may I have full
knowledge of existence and beyond.

_=——-

शूद्राय चायींय a tara चारंणाय क । प्रियो देवानां
दक्षिंणायै दातुरिह भूयासमयं मे ara: सर्मृध्यतामुर्पमादो
नमतु ॥२॥

Yathemam vacam kalyanimavadani janebhyah.
Brahmarajanyabhyam sudraya caryaya ca
svaya caranaya ca. Priyo devanam daksinayai
daturiha bhuyasamayam me kamah samrdhya-
tamupa mado namatu.

Just as this blessed Word of the Veda I speak for
the people, all without exception, Brahmana, Kshatriya,
Shudra, Vaishya, master and servant, one’s own and
others, so do you too.

May I be dear and favourite with the noble
divinities and the generous people for the gift of the
sacred speech.

May this noble aim of mine be fulfilled here in
this life. May the others too follow and come my way
beyond this life.
