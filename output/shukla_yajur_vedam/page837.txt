804 YAJURVEDA

Indra, lord of the earth and the divine Word,
highpriest of a hundred yajnas of life, come here and
drink of the soma extracted by the existent scholars with
the sacred stones and distilled by the clouds.

Man of divine knowledge, master of your mind
and senses, consecrated you are to Indra, lord of earth
and Veda. I accept you for the service of Indra and
education of the people. This service and dedication is
now your haven and home, the end and aim of your life.

5. (Surya Devata, Ramyakshi Rshi)

इन्द्रार्याहि वृत्रहन् पिबा सोर्मश्शातक्रतो । गोर्मद्भिर्ग्रर्वभि:
सुतम्। उपयामर्गृहीतोऽसीन्द्राय त्वा गोर्मतऽएष ते योनिरिन्द्राय
त्वा गोर्मते ॥७॥

Gomadbhirgravabhih sutam. Upayamagrhito’
sindraya tva gomata’ esa te yonirindraya tva
gomate.

Indra, lord of sunbeams, breaker of the clouds and
high-priest of a hundred yajnas of creation, come and
drink of the soma extracted by brilliant men of knowledge
and wealth of self-control with the voice of thunder and
showers of clouds.

Man of brilliance and knowledge, accepted and
consecrated you are like an oblation held in the
sacrificial ladle for the service of Indra, lord of the sun
and clouds. This service and dedication now is your
haven and home, the very reason and justification of your
existence. I accept you for Indra and the man of wealth
and self-control.
