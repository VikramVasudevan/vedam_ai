812 YAJURVEDA

Man of holy speech, leader and high-priest of
yajna, drink the soma and praise and celebrate our yajna
alongwith the season. You alone are the creator and giver
of the wealth of the world.

22. (Soma Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

द्वविणोदा: fidtata जुहोत woot तिष्ठत |
नेष्ट्धादुतुर्भिरिष्यत ॥२२॥

Dravinodah pipisati juhota pra ca tisthata.
Nestradrtubhirisyata.

The generous man of wealth and honour wants to
drink the soma of health from the flask with humility
according to the seasons. Feel the desire, you too search
and you shall find the juice. Perform the homa, abide
and win honour and settlement.

23. (Vidvan Devata, Medhatithi Rshi)

तवायश्सोमस्त्वमेह्यर्वाङ् शंश्वत्तमश्सुमर्नाऽअस्य पांहि |
अस्मिन्यज्ञे बर्हिष्या ferent दधिष्वेमं जठरऽइन्दुमिन्द्र ॥२३॥

Tavayam somastvamehyarvan Sasvattamaim
sumana’asya pahi. Asmin yajne barhisya
nisadya dadhisvemam jathara’ indumindra.

Indra, man of knowledge in search of honour and
power, this soma is yours. Come straight on here and,
happy at heart, protect, preserve and advance this eternal
Dharma of joy in action.

In this yajna, sit on the holy seats of blessed grass,
take this nectar of life and light and hold it in your vital
being.
