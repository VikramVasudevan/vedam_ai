886 YAJURVEDA

Let the devotee of national yajna offer service
with yajna to Indra, virile hero of manly deeds and chief
of the council, sitting on the vedi along-with his
colleagues of the Vasu, Rudra and Aditya order of
education and national discipline. And Indra would
grace the yajna of the people and lead them to the highest
state of power and prosperity.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna, never relent.
5. (Indra Devata, Brihaduktha Vamadeva Rshi)

Slat यक्षदोजो न वीर्युश्सहो FESS PAARL | सुप्रायणाऽ-
अस्मिन् at विश्रंयन्तामृतावृधो द्वारऽइन्द्राय मीढुषे
व्यन्त्वार्ज्यस्य होतर्यर्जं uu

Hota yaksadojo na viryam saho dvara’indram-
avardhayan. Suprdyana’ asmin yajne vi Sray-
antamrtavrdho dvara’ indraya midhuse
vyantvajyasya hotaryaja.

Man of yajna, perform the yajna in honour of
Indra, powerful and glorious personality of the nation.
Just as wide open gates augment the flood of waters so
may the doors of yajna augment the vigour, valour and
brilliance of the nation. And in this national yajna, may
the saints and sages going by the paths of rectitude and
extending the bounds of truth open wide the gates of
glory and advancement for the bountiful Indra.

Man of yajna, go on with the yajna, relent not.
6. (Indra Devata, Brihaduktha Vamadeva Rshi)

होतां यक्षदुषेऽइन्द्रस्य धेनू सुदुर्घे मातरां wet | सवातरौ न
तेर्जसा वत्समिर्नद्रमवर्द्धतां वीतामार्ज्यस्य होतर्यर्जं ॥६॥
