CHAPTER-XXVIII 837

Hota yaksaduse’indrasya dhenu sudughe matara
mahi. Savatarau na tejasa vatsamindrama-
vardhatam vitamdajyasya hotaryaja.

Let the hota, man of yajna, perform yajna in
honour and service of the morning dawn and the evening
twilight, which, like two great generous mother cows
in the open air of universal energy, nourish Indra, the
sun, like a calf and feed it with light and augment its

glory.
Hota, do the yajna, increase and extend the beauty
and glory of the world and enjoy. Never relent.

7. (Ashvinau Devate, Brihaduktha Vamadeva Rshi)

होर्तां यक्षद्दैव्या होर्तारा भिषजा eater हविषेन्द्रं भिषज्यत:।
wat देवौ प्रचेतसाविन्द्रांय धत्तऽइन्द्रियं वीतामार्ज्यस्य
होतर्यजं ॥७॥

Hota yaksaddaivya hotara bhisaja sakhaya
havisendram bhisajyatah. Kavi devau
pracetasavindraya  dhatta’  indriyam
vitamajyasya hotaryaja.

Let the hota offer the oblations in honour and
service for the Ashvinis, two high-priests of nature in
the fields of health and well-being. They are the
physicians, friends, who carry on the yajna for the health
of Indra, the soul in body. Both of them, wise visionaries,
brilliant and generous, masters of divine science, work
for and extend the health and well-being of Indra.

Hota, carry on the yajna, augment and extend the
health and well-being of humanity and enjoy yourself
too.
