838 YAJURVEDA

8.‘ (Indra Devata, Brihaduktha Vamadeva Rshi)
aa यक्षक्तिस्त्रो देवीर्न staat त्रर्यस्त्रिधार्तवोऽपसऽइडा

सरस्वती and मही: । इर्नद्रपत्नीर्हुविरष्मतीर्व्यन्त्वार्ज्यस्य
होतर्यर्ज ॥८॥

Hota yaksattisro devirna bhesajam trayastri-
dhatavo’ pasa’ida sarasvati bharati mahth
Indrapatnirhavismatirvyantvajyasya hotaryaja.

Let the hota, man of yajna, offer yajna for the

sake of the health and happiness of the soul to the three
great divinities, Ida, potential speech of divine
omniscience, Saraswati, divine Word of knowledge, and
Bharati, language of the world-knowledge of science.

Let the three, teacher, preacher and physician
(agents of great actions and creators of three supreme
humors of body-health), as three servants of the regions
of earth, sky and heaven, serve with yajna the three
divinities of Ida, Saraswati and Bharati.

And the three, teacher, preacher and the
physician, and the three mother-sustainers of the soul,
generous with the wealth of life, would bless the soul
and the world with plenty of health and well-being.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna, never relent.

9. (Indra Devata, Prajapati Rshi)

पुरुरूर्पश ode मघोनमिन्द्राय त्वष्टा दर्धदिन्द्रियाणि

Hota yaksattvastaramindram devam bhisajam
suyajam ghrtasriyam. Pururupam suretasam
maghonamindraya tvasta dadhadindriyani
vetvajyasya hotaryaja.
