CHAPTER-XXVIII 839

Let the hota, yajaka, offer yajna to Tvashta, maker
of refined forms beyond weaknes. He blesses, Indra,
valorous, glorious and generous, physician, honourable
in yajna, abundant and graceful, versatile in various fields
and nobly virile, lord of power and grandeur. And Tvashta
would bless you with the excellence of mind and sense
and create all the knowledge of sense and mind and
culture for you.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna, never relent.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna, relent not.
