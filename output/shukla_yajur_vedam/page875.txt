CHAPTER -XXVIII 841

Let the fire and splendour of yajna blazing in the
vedi, invoked in the morning and preserved at night,
advance Indra, power of world knowledge, divine
among divines, surrounded by the noblest presences like
a hero. Let the fire rise to the heavens across the air and
waters in the sky and advance Indra with wealth and
prosperity.

Hota, man of yajna, carry on the yajna, advance
the wealth and knowledge of the world for the world of
humanity and enjoy yourself too.

13. (Indra Devata, Ashvins Rshi)

वसुवर्ने वसुधेर्यस्य व्यन्तु ast ॥१३॥

Devirdvara’indrain sanghate vidviryamanna-
vardhayan. A vatsena tarunena kumarena ca
mivataparvanain renukakatam nudantam
vasuvane vasudheyasya vyantu yaja.

Let the strong and celestial doors of the nation’s
march open wide and advance Indra onward in the social
dynamics of progress, removing the whirlwinds of the
dust of time and urging him on like a horse spurred on
by a darling youthful prince brilliant as the rising sun.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna, let the wealth
and honour of the nation rise for all, and enjoy.

14. (Ahoratre Devate, Ashvinau Rshi)

देवीऽउषासानक्तेनद्र यज्ञे प्रंयत्व्रह्वेताम् 1 दैवीर्बिश:
प्रार्यासिष्टाध्ठंसुप्रीते सुर्धिते वसुवर्ने वसुधेर्यस्य वीतां
ast ॥१४॥
