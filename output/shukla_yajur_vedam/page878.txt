844 YAJURVEDA

fire, generous and brilliant, full of divine properties,
feed the sun-beams with the fragrance of yajna and the
smell of earth and add to the prosperity of the world.
They eliminate the agents of sin and crime (by the
elimination of poverty) and burn out the causes of
disease. Full of the spirit of nature’s wisdom, they beget
choice gifts of wealth and water and promote the
blessings of God upon the earth for the yajamana.

Man of yajna, carry on with the yajna in unison
with nature, never relent.

18. (Indra Devata, Ashvinau Rshi)

देवीस्तिस्त्रस्तिस्रो देवी: पतिमिर्द्रमवर्द्धधयन् । अरस्पृक्षद्भारंती
feck esis सरस्वतीडा adudt गृहान् र्वसुवर्ने ae
धेर्यस्य व्यन्तु Ast ॥१८॥

Devistisrastisro devih patimindramavardhayan.
Asprksadbharati divam rudrairyajnam
sarasvatida vasumati grhan vasuvane
vasudheyasya vyantu yaja.

Three divine powers serve, strengthen and elevate
Indra, the human soul, their master and servant both,
with three sacred processes of action: Bharati, the speech
and light of sattva, with the energy of the Rudra pranas,
reaches the light of heaven. Sarasvati, the speech and
currents of nature’s dynamics, with sacred chants
through fire and wind, expands the yajna and refines
the business of living. And Ida, the earth and holy
libations, bear worldly wealth and bless the homes with
prosperity. Thus the three divinities bring down the riches
of the Divine Giver into the life of humanity, the receiver,
on earth through yajna.

Hota, devotee of yajna, carry on the yajna in tune
