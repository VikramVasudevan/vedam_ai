and pleasing to the eye and, like them, offer yajna to
Indra, lord of the world’s life and age, and holding on
to the wisdom of the Trishtubh verses, strength, speed
of progress, wealth and sensitivity, and strong burden-
bearing bulls in this world, create, promote and enjoy
the beauty and grace of life as do the night and day.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna in unison with
the night and day.

होरतां यक्षत्प्रचेतसा देवारनामुत्तमं यशो होर्तारा deat कवी
सयुजेन्द्रं वयोधर्सम् | जर्गतीं छन्दंऽइन्द्रियर्मनड्वाहं गां
वयो दर्धद्बीतामार्ज्यस्य होतर्यर्जं ॥३०॥

Hota yaksatpracetasa devanamuttamam yaSso
hotara daivya kavi sayujendram vayodhasam.
Jagatim chanda’indriyamanadvaham gam vayo
dadhadvitamdjyasya hotaryaja.

Let the hota join Prachetas, two wise and brilliant
high-priests (such as the fire and the sun or the teacher
and the disciple), both of divine nature, creative, and
friendly as brothers, and offer yajna to Indra, most
glorious among the generous powers of brilliance and
giver of health, wealth and long age, and, holding on
to the wisdom of jagati verses, freedom and joy of life,
sensitivity and intelligence, bulls of the chariot and the
wealth and beauty of life, create, promote and enjoy
the sweetest graces of the world as the Prachetas do as
friends.

Man of yajna, carry on the yajna in unison with
the friendly divinities of nature and society.
