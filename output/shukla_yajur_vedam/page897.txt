CHAPTER-XXVIII 863

To-day this yajamana, cooking the holy food,
cooking the pudding, and tending and binding the goat
for the holy milk of health for Indra, lord of life and
wealth, may choose to honour the divine Agni, brilliant
scholar, as the high-priest of yajna.

To-day may the divine Vanaspati, lord of sun-
beams and the fascinating forest and meadow come
close to grace the yajamana with the goat for milk and
with catalytic holy materials of yajna in honour of Indra,
lord of the commonwealth and the social order.

O Rshi, man of vedic vision, may the yajamana
invite and entertain you to-day with the holy food being
cooked and seasoned with delicacies.

And may the yajamana and the priest and the Rshi
and you all partake of the holy food today and grow
higher and ever higher.
