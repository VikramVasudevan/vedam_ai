अग्निष्ट्वां देवैर्वसुभि: सजोर्षा: प्रीतं वह्निं वहतु जात-

Vajin, scholar technologist of the speed of the
winds, working restlessly like a restive courser, worthy
of praise you are, a celebrity, quick in action and revered
on the vedi of science-yajna. May Agni, lord omniscient

reveal to you the secrets of fire and energy cherished
by you, alongwith the treasures of the powers of devas
and Vasus such as earth, air and sky.

expansive over the earth, and immanent in all the natural
powers of the universe. May Aditi, infinite and eternal
mother spirit of creativity, loving, loved and admired
by her devotees, always doing good to her children,
