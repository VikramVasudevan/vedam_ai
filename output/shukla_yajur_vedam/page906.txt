872 YAJURVEDA

I see the treasures of the beneficiaries of their hoofs. I
see the auspicious reins of your power and force which
are all-round defenders of truth and law and which
protect the law-abiding.

17. (Agni Devata, Bhargavo Jamadagni Rshi)
आत्मार्ने ते मर्नसारादजानामवो feat पतर्यन्तं पतङ्गम् ।
शिरोऽअपश्यं पथिर्भि: सुगेर्भिररेणुभिर्जेर्हमानं पतत्तरि ॥१७॥

Atmanadm te manasdraddajandmavo diva
patayantam patangam. Siro’apasyam pathibhih
sugebhirarenubhirjehamanam patatri.

Agni, fire energy, with my own mind and
knowledge, I know your soul in body form so close
being flown from down below through space to the sun.
I see your head soaring up, voraciously sucking the air
and struggling to ascend by clear and dustless paths of
the sky.

18. (Agni Devata, Bhargavo Jamadagni Rshi)

sat ते रूपर्मुत्तमर्मपश्यं Rritvarorirassm wa गो: |
Gat a diss भोगमानडादिद् ग्रसिंष्ठऽओर्षधी-
रजीग: ॥१८॥

Atra te rupamuttamamapasyam jigisamanamisa’
a pade goh. Yada te marto’anu bhogamanadadid
grasistha’osadhirajigah.

Agni, victorious power, here I see your most
splendid form eager to win the wealth of food and energy
of the earth. Only when your people have received their
portion of the food, only then you, most voracious
though, take your share of the nourishing foods and
herbs.
