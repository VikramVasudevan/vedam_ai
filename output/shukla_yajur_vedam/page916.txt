882 YAJURVEDA

A very image of the cloud he seems to be when
the hero in armour goes forward to join the ardent
watriors in the raging battle. Come victorious, warrior,
with your body unscathed. May the mighty grandeur of
the armour protect and promote you.

39. (Viras Warriors Devata, Bharadvaja Rshi)
erdat गा e-darssft र्जयेम erdar तीव्रा: समर्दो
जयेम ॥ धनु: शत्रोरपकामं shone eta walt: wfersit
जयेम ॥३९॥

Dhanvana ga dhanvana” jim jayema dhanvana

tivrah samado jayema. Dhanuh Ssatrora-

pakamam krnoti dhanvana sarvah pradiso
jJayema.

Let us win the earths by the bow, win the battle

by the bow, win the violent wars by the bow. The bow

it is that shatters the enemy’s ambition for evil. Let us
win in all directions by the bow.

40. (Viras, Devata, Bharadwaja Rshi)
पारर्यन्ती ॥४०॥

Vaksyantivedaganiganti karnam priyam
sakhayam parisasvajana. Yoseva Sinkte vitatadhi
dhanavanjya iyam samane parayanti.

This string stretched on the bow is drawn close
to the ear and, like a young woman embracing her dear
husband and whispering love into his ear, twangs,
carrying the warrior across the battle to victory.
