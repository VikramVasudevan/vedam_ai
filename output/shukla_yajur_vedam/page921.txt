The warriors spur the horses on the sides and

strike them with the goad on the shanks. Expert teacher,
the horses are intelligent and responsive, train them in
quick curves and movements of battle.

अर्हिरिव भोगै: पर्ये`ति are ज्यायां हेतिं र्परिबार्धमान: |

Like the hand-guard warding off the strikes of

the bow-string with its coils and protecting the hand of
the archer, the expert commander of the army and the
man of laws and ways of the world, by the blows of his
arms and himself facing the challenges, protects the
people from all round and, like the cloud, showers all
the peace and comfort on them.
