898 YAJURVEDA

For the rivers, the fisherman; for the fast she-
bears, the forester; for the tiger-man, the drunken fool;
for the musicians and dancers, the brute; for the farmers,
the demented; for the snakes and nobles, the neurotic;
for the desirables, the gambler; for the retiring, the non-
gambler; for the frustrated, the cynic; for travellers, the
thorns; for the sake of these former ones, keep off the
latter ones.

Keep off the paramour out to meet his mistress;
the adulterer heading to the house of his married love;
the unmarried elder brother with his eye on the wife of
his younger brother; the younger brother grabbing and
encroaching upon the elder brother’s share of land; the
husband of younger sister entertaining love for the
unmarried elder sister-in-law; the self-decorated sex-
doll impatient to make up for lost opportunities; the
amorous woman excited for sex; the inmate intending
to abuse the house-mate; the solicitor trying for
acceptance; the corrupt official in search of gratification
for work.
