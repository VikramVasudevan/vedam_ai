दुष्कृताय चरंकाचार्यं पाप्मने सैलगम् ॥१८॥

Remove the gambler playing for his den-master,
the tormenter of the cow to death, the butcher who
slaughters the cow, the man who impairs the cow to
satisfy hunger, the man who approaches the beef carver
asking for food, the beggar serving his master of the
den, and the robber out for sin and crime.

Give us the man of original vision for the age of
truth (Krita-yuga), the man of imagination for the age
of thought and resolution (Treta-yuga), the man of
imagination and resolution for the age of thought and
passion (Dvapara-yuga), and the man-pillar of the
council for speedy progress and development.
