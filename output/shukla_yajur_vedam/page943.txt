CHAPTER-XXXI 909

So great as the universe 1s the grandeur and glory
of It, and yet the Purusha is greater. The entire worlds
of existence are but one fourth aspect of Its reality (just
like the foot-stool of a mighty monarch). Three parts of
Its mystery are in the transcendental heaven of
immortality, Infinity, beyond the created universe of
existence.

4. (Purusha Devata, Narayana Rshi)

forged उदैत्पुरुंष: पार्दोऽस्येहार्भवत्पुर्न: |
ततो विष्वङ् व्यक्रामत्साशनानशनेऽअभि ॥४॥

Tripadurdhva udaitpurusah pdado’syehabhavat
punah. Tato visvan vyakramat saSananasane’

abhi.

Thrice more glorious arises the Purusha above
the created universe wherein one measure of His
greatness and grandeur manifests again and again,
pervading all the eating and non-eating world, and
thence remains transcendent across and over the
universe.

5. (Srashta Devata, Narayana Rshi)
तर्तो विरार्डजायत विराजोऽअधि gee: |
स जातोऽअर्त्यरिच्यत पश्चाद् भूमिमर्थो Te: GU
Tato viradajayata virajo’adhi purusah. Sa jato’
atyaricyata pascad bhumimatho purah.

From Purusha arises Virat, the cosmic form,
Prakriti. The Purusha manifests therein and remains
sovereign over the Virat. Yet, even while manifest in
the Virat, He remains apart and uninvolved before and

after the creation and then creates the earth and human
habitations. (That is cosmic yajna.)
