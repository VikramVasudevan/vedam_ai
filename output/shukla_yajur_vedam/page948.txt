914 YAJURVEDA

gross elements, five faculties of perception, and three
qualities of the material universe which are Sattva, Rajas
and Tamas (Thought/intelligence, energy and matter).

In Rgvedadi-Bhashya-Bhumika, his Introduction
to the Commentary on the Vedas, he explains the same
thing in a different and detailed manner in the chapter
on Creation.

For an average reader, the simpler way to
understand is to refer to the seven stages of creative
evolution: Prakriti, Mahan, Ahankara, Tanmatra,
Perception faculty, Volition faculty, and gross elements.
These stages of evolution are the seven bounds of
creative yajna performed by Purusha. These are also
the Samidhas because each succeeding evolute arises
from yajnic consumption of the previous one. And each
one has three orders of quality, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
That makes it thrice seven.

This is the Sankhya order of evolution, and
‘Sankhya’ is the word from which comes the English
word ‘Science’ through Latin in which it is written as
‘Scienkia’.

Another way to realise the seven boundaries is
to refer to the seven Vyahritis: Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah,
Maha, Janah, Tapah and Satyam which are the boundaries
of each loka or region in ascending order.

यज्ञेर्न यज्ञर्मयजन्त देवास्तानि धर्मीणि प्रथमान्यांसन् 1 ते
ह्र We महिमार्न: Gerd aa पूर्वे साध्या: सन्तिं देवा:॥१६॥
Yajnena yajnamayajanta devastani dharmani
prathamanyasan. Te ha nakam mahimanah
sacanta yatra purve sadhyah santi devah.
