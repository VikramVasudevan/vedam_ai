CHAPTER-XXXII 919

3. (Hiranyagarbha Paramatma Devata, Svayambhu
Brahma Rshi)

न aet ufaarsstitea यस्य art महद्यर्श: | हिरण्यगर्भऽ-
इत्येष मा at हिश्सीदित्येषा यस्मान्न जातऽइत्येष:॥३॥

Na tasya pratima ’asti yasya nama mahadyasah.
Hiranyagarbha’ityesa ma ma hiimsidityesa
yasmanna jata’ityesah.

There is none and nothing like Him, no picture,
no icon, no simile, no metaphor. Great is His Name,
mighty His glory. “He is the Golden Seed of the
universe’, it is apparent. “No, no, do not kill me, do not
punish, I pray”, such is the prayer of humanity to Him.
“No one ever born is greater than He or beyond Him”,
such is clearly the voice of the Veda.

4. (Atma Devata, Svayambhu Brahma Rshi)

wat हं da: प्रदिशोऽनु wal: gat ह wa: Usz
गर्भेऽअन्त:। सऽएव Va: स र्जनिष्यर्मांण: Were जर्ना-
स्तिष्ठति सर्वतोमुख:।॥४॥।

Eso ha devah pradiso’nu sarvah purvo ha jatah
sa’ u garbhe’ antah. Sa’eva jatah sa janisya-
manah pratyan janastisthati sarvatomukhah.

Children of divinity, verily this glorious lord of
the universe pervades all regions and quarters of space.
First born, i.e., manifested, of existence, in truth, He is
at the very centre of the universe and in the depths of
the soul. Existent and manifest, He continues to manifest
every moment and abides everywhere in everything
facing forward in all directions.
