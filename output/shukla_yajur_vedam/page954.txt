920 YAJURVEDA

5. (Paramatma Devata, Svayambhu Brahma Rshi)

यस्माज्जातं न पुरा fe waa य ओआंबभूव भुर्वनानि
विश्वां | प्रजार्पति: प्रजयां सरराणस्त्रीणि ज्योतींश्डैषि
सचते स atest

Yasmajjatam na pura kim canaiva ya ababhuva
bhuvanani visva. Prajapatih prajaya samra-
ranastrini jyohmsi sacate sa sodasi.

The glorious lord is He, nothing whatever was
born before Him, none of all those worlds of the universe
which came into existence later. Father and sustainer,
abiding and rejoicing with His creation, lord of sixteen
powers of perfection, He pervades and feeds the three
lights of the earth, sky and heaven, i.e., fire, electric
energy and sunlight.

Note:- Sixteen seems to be the number of kalas
(qualities, attributes, virtues and faculties) which
comprise the model of perfection from different points
of view. From Prashnopanishad, 6, 4, for example, we
learn that ‘sixteen kalas’ means the sixteen creative
powers of the Purusha, sixteen evolutionary stages of
the created universe, and sixteen virtues, qualities and
faculties of both cosmic and individual existence. These
kalas are : Prana or energy and the Hiranyagarbha or
the universally fertilized golden seed of the universe,
shraddha or faith, akasha or space, vayu or wind energy,
agni or fire and light, apah or waters, prithivi or earth,
indriya or faculties of perception and volition, mana or
mind, anna or food, virya or vitality of generation, tapa
or discipline of inviolable austerity, mantra or
knowledge or the art of living, karma or action, loka or
world regions of the universe, and nama or individuality
and identity.
