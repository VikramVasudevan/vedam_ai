CHAPTER-XXXII 921

In Atharva-veda, 13, 4, 47-54, the divine virtues
are described as: Shachipati or omnipotent, vibhu or
infinite, prabhu or lord of all, ambha or cool as water,
ama or energiser, mahasaha or constant, aruna rajata
raja or brilliant, lovely and glorious, uru prithu or vast,
subhu or grand, bhuva or omniscient, pratho vara or
highest and best, vyacho loka or omnipresent, bhavad-
vasu or lord of universal honour, idadvasu or lord of
universal wealth, samyatvasu or perefectly self-
controlled, and ayat-vasu or ever lustrous and
honourable.

Reference may be made to Satyarth Prakash,
chapter I, in which Swami Dayanand has listed 108
attributive names of Ishvara. ‘Sixteen’ refers to an ideal
conceptual model.

Yena dyaurugra prthivi ca drdha yena svah

By Him the heavens blaze, by Him the earth is
firm, by Him the heaven of bliss is sustained, by Him
the ecstasy of Moksha is constant, and He is the creator
of the worlds in space. Let us worship that lord of glory
and eternal bliss, and let us sing in honour of Him with
the fragrance of yajna.
