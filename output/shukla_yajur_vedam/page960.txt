926 YAJURVEDA

May Indra, lord of universal grandeur, and the
leader of honour and power, bless me with honourable
intelligence.

May Vayu, lord of universal energy and power,
and the scholar of science and technology, bless me with
intellectual and vitalizing intelligence.

May Dhata, lord preserver of the universe, and
scholar of life-sciences, bless me with life-preserving
intelligence.

This is the divine voice from the heart.

May this knowledge of mine and the Brahmana
fellowship, and this power and honour of mine and the
Kshatra organisation, both grow to excellence and grace.
May the noblest people bless me with the best of
excellence and grace.

All the best for you in truth of word and deed.
This is the divine voice of the soul.
