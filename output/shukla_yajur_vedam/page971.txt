Brhannididhma’esam bhuri sSastam prthuh
svaruh. Yesamindro yuva sakha.

Great is the fame and excellence of those whose
friend is Indra, boundless, blazing, expansive, glorious
and unaging lord.

25. (Indra Devata, Madhuchhanda Rshi)

इन्द्रेहि ueaea विश्वेभि: सोमपर्वभि: 1
महाँ२॥ऽर्जभिष्टिरोर्जसा ure

Indrehi matsyandhaso visvebhih somaparva-
bhih. Mahan’ abhistirojasa.

Indra, lord of might and knowledge, great,
honoured and worshipped by virtue of your own
splendour and glory, come and join all our soma
offerings and enjoy the delicacies of our yajna to your
heart’s content.

26. (Indra Devata, Vishvamitra Rshi)

इन्द्रो qaigquizs-d dita: प्र मायिर्नाममिनाद्वर्प`णीति:।
अहन् व्यश्समुशधग्वर्नेष्वाविर्धेर्नाऽअकृणोद्राम्यारणाम् ॥२६॥

Indro vrtramavrnocchardhanitih pra mayinama-
minad varpanitih Ahan vyamsamuSadha-
gvanesvavirdhena ’akrnodramyanam.

Indra, ruling lord of light and power, challenges
the dark clouds of evil and crime. Strong of policy and
versatile of working ways and forms, he frustrates the
designs of the cunning. Scourge of thieves and grabbers
hiding in the forests, he breaks their arms and burns
them to dust. And he gives full expression to the voice
and actions of those who contribute to delightful peace
and prosperity.
