peace and joy, Prithivi, riches of the earth, Dyau, the
sun in heaven, Maruts, fastest human powers, wealth
of the mountains and clouds, the energy of waters and
rain, and I pray to Vishnu, omnipresent spirit of the
universe, Pusha, nature’s spirit of health and
refreshment, Brahmanaspati, guardian Spirit of the
universe and knowledge, Bhaga, lord giver of wealth
and honour, and the celebrated Savita, creator, sustainer
and light-giver of the world, for protection and well-
being.

For him who prays, sings hymns of praise, and is
strong and rich with oblations for the divinities : for
him and for us all, the Rudras, powers of justice and
punishment, rich and generous people, clouds and
mountains, heroes who rise with us on the call to battle
for elimination of the enemy, followers of the powerful
leader Indra, and the noblest powers of nature and
humanity, we pray, protect us.
