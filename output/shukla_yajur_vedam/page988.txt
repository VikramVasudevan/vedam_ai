954 YAJURVEDA

Indra, lord of honour and power, commanding
homage and obedience, riding horses of lightning speed,
those noble scholars and pious people who invoke you
and exalt you with the call to battle against the clouds
of drought and darkness, those who call you to battle
against the enemies of goodness, and those who exhort
you to battle for light along with the sun-beams, and
those who join you rejoicing with you in celebrations,
with all these, with your troops and commandos, and
with your tempestuous friends and forces drink the soma
of honour and glory of success.

64. (Indra Devata, Gauriviti Rshi)

अर्वर्द्धन्निन्द्रं मरुर्तश्चिद्त्र माता यद्वीरं दधनद्भर्निष्ठा ॥६४॥

Janistha’ugrah sahase turaya mandra’ ojistho
bahulabhimanah. Avardhannindram marutasci-
datra mata yadviram dadhanad dhanistha.

Indra, mighty ruling power, awfully strong, whom
the noblest mother bore and shaped as a great hero,
highly adorable for instant action and splendid victories,
most lustrous and pride of many whom the most
dynamic leaders and scholars admire and exalt here in
the land, rise and create joy and prosperity all round.

A ti na’indra vrtrahannasmakamardhama gahi.
Mahan mahibhirutibhih.

Indra, glorious leader and ruler, destroyer of the
demon of darkness, come soon and bring all round
