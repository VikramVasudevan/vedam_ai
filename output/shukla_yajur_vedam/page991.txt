CHAPTER-XXXIII 957

Vayu, powerful ruler, and people, your brilliant
forces, trained through discipline like distilled soma,
decent men of honeyed culture, have beaten the enemy
with courage and yajnic actions.

Come Vayu, with them rejoicing, bear the soma
and the gifts of yajna and drink with joy the distilled
nectar of active life.

71. (Mitra & Varuna Devate, Vasishtha Rshi)

गावऽउर्पावतावतं Yet यज्ञस्यं रप्सुदां |
sur quit हिरण्ययां ॥७१॥

Gava’upavatavatam mahi yajnasya rapsuda.
Ubha karna hiranyaya.

May the cows and rays of the sun rays protect
and promote yajna. May the great earth and heaven,
both active and golden generous, makers of beautiful
forms, protect and promote the form and function of
yajna.

72. (Vidvan Devata, Daksha Rshi)

कार्व्ययोराजारनेषु क्रत्वा दर्क्षस्य दुरोणे |

रिशादसा सधस्थऽआ ॥७२॥

Kavyayorajanesu kratva daksasya durone.
Risadasa sadhastha’a.

Scholars, teachers and preachers, dispellers of the
darkness of ignorance, come to the assembly home of
this versatile genius and grace the seats of the creation
of great literature with your knowledge and wisdom of
truth and noble action.
