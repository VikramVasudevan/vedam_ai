CHAPTER-XXXIII 963

Vayu, ruler of the winds and power, come and
grace our yajna with precious gifts of knowledge and
science so that the flames of fire may rise and reach the
heights of heaven, and I, this devotee of the holy fire,
inward purified, upward expansive with the flames,
mentally shining and spiritually crystallized may come
to you.

86. (Indra-Vayu Devate, Tapasa Rshi)

इन्द्ववायू सुंसन्दृशां सुहवेह र्हवामहे |
यथा a: सर्वऽडज्जर्नोऽनमीव: ast सुमनाऽअर्सत् ॥८६॥

Indravayu susandrsa suhaveha havamahe.
Yatha nah sarva’ijjano’namivah sangame
sumana’asat.

Unto this yajna of life and progress, we invoke
and invite Indra, sovereign ruler of the world, and Vayu,
universal power and energy, both of benign and blissful
eye and eager to come and bless, so that, we pray, this
entire human family of ours live free from want and
suffering and, happy at heart, unite to act in joint
ventures of universal well-being.

87. (Mitra & Varuna Devate, Jamadagni Rshi)

ऋर्धगित्था स मर्त्य: sea caataa |
यो नूनं मित्रावरूंणावभिष्टयऽआच्क्रे हव्यदातये ॥८७॥

Rdhagittha sa martyah sasame devatdtaye. Yo
nunam mitravarunavabhistaya’acakre havya-
dataye.

Blessed is the man, for sure, who thus for the

sake of peace and service of the wise and for positive
values invokes and invites Mitra, lord of universal love
