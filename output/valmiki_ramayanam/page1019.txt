“A son who is virtuous and _ fully
amenable to control is easy to get; but
nowhere can a son like Angada be found.
Nor is there a land where proximity to a co-
uterine brother can be had, O gallant prince !

“Angada, the foremost of heroes, may
no longer survive the death of his father;
while his mother can survive only to take
care of her son. But without her son she will
never survive, miserable as she is through
agony caused by her husband’s death: this
is my positive belief. (21)

“Seeking to be on a par with my
deceased brother and son (Angada, who is
sure to die), | shall accordingly enter a
blazing fire. Remaining at your beck and
call, these foremost heroes among monkeys
will search for Sita. (22)

रामानुजानीहि कृतागसं ALU 23

“Even when | have passed away, O
prince, this object of yours will undoubtedly
be accomplished in its entirety. Therefore, O
Rama, grant me leave to die, |, who am the
destroyer of my race, and therefore an offender
and as such not fit to survive.” (23)

श्रुत्वा वचो वालिजघन्यजस्य।
TH मुहूर्तं विमना बभूव॥ २४॥
Moved to tears to hear the foregoing
lament of the wretched Sugriva (the younger
brother of Vall), Sri Rama, the foremost
hero of the Raghus, the slayer of hostile
warriors, felt discomposed for a_ while.

रामो रुदन्तीं व्यसने निमग्नां
समुत्सुक: ASA Tat ताराम्॥ २५ Ul
Looking round again and again most
eagerly, the celebrated Sri Rama, the
protector of the world, who was full of
forbearance like the earth, presently beheld
at that moment Tara, who was plunged
overhead in adversity and was, therefore,
weeping. (25)

The foremost of Vali’s ministers lifted
up that noble-minded wife of Vali, Tara,
who had lovely eyes and who lay at that
moment closely embracing her husband,
who was the sovereign of lions among
monkeys. (26)

Struggling to extricate herself from their
grip when being torn asunder from her
husband, and clinging to him again, Tara
beheld Sri Rama, carrying an arrow and a
bow in his hands, and shining like the blazing
sun in his brilliance. (27)
