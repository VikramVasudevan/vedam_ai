Canto XXIX

Recounting the virtues of Sri Rama to Sugriva, who had due to his love of the
pleasures of sense forgotten all about Sri Rama’s business and was
neglecting it even after the advent of autumn—and reminding him
of the work of Sri Rama, Hanuman urges Sugriva to collect an
army with a view to conducting a search for Sita. Awakened
to a sense of his duty, Sugriva enjoins Nila to dispatch
messengers to bring all the Vanara hordes together

Vividly perceiving the sky to be clear
and free from lightning and clouds, crowded
with cranes and resonant with their cries
and illumined with lovely light, seeing that
Sugriva, whose object had been fully
achieved, was tardy in acquiring fortune
and religious merit, that he had completely
taken to the path of the unworthy (the path
of sensuality) and neglecting the duties of
kingship had set his mind on privacy, that,
his work having been accomplished and
purpose having been achieved, he ever felt

delighted in the company of young women,
that, having realized all the cherished objects
of his desire and having got his own beloved
wife, Ruma, as well as Tara, who was
keenly sought after by him, he was revelling
day and night, his object having been
accomplished and his anxiety having
completely gone, and was diverting himself
as Indra (the ruler of gods) does with troops
of Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and
Apsaras (celestial nymphs), that having
entrusted the work of administration to his
ministers, he did not keep an eye on them
and that he had become licentious, as it
were, the peril to his kingdom having ceased,
thanks to the loyalty of his ministers,
Hanuman, son of the wind-god—who had
ascertained the tenor of all the sacred books
and as such knew the truth about all that
ought to be done and that ought not to be
done, and further knew the special duties
relating to a particular occasion—and was
adept in expression—approached Sugriva,
the ruler of monkeys, who arrived at the
truth underlying what was said to him,
was full of love and affection for Hanuman
and was definite about the latter's
trustworthiness—and having propitiated him
by means of various reasoned expressions,
pleasing to the mind, addressed to
Sugriva the following friendly, truthful and
wholesome words, which were persuasive,
righteous, full of meaning and prudent too :
“Sovereignty as well as fame have been
