“Go and let Sugriva be apprised of the
turn which my wrath may take, O valiant
prince possessed of extraordinary might,
and administer to him the following warning:

(80)
न स संकुचित: wer येन वाली हतो गत:।
समये तिष्ठ सुग्रीव मा वालिपथमन्वगा:॥८१॥

‘The route by which Vali has departed
on being killed by me on the field of battle
has not been closed. Therefore, abide by
the pledge given by you, pray, do not follow
the path of Vall. (81)

एक Va WH वाली शरेण निहतो मया।
wat तु सत्यादतिक्रान्तं हनिष्यामि सबान्धवम्॥ ८२॥
‘Vali alone was killed by me with an
arrow while | will kill you with all your
kinsfolk since you have deviated from truth.’
(82)

aed विहिते ard यद्धितं पुरुषर्षभ।
तत् ag ब्रूहि नरश्रेष्ठं त्वर कालव्यतिक्रम: ॥ ८३॥
“When the work of initiating a search
for Sita has been impeded in this way, pray,
speak to Sugriva whatever is good for him
as well as for us, O jewel among men!

Make haste, O ornament of humanity ! Let
there be no delay. (83)

कुरुष्व Us मम वानरेश्वर
प्रतिश्रुतं धर्ममवेक्ष्य शाश्वतम्।

“Address in my name the following
appeal to Sugriva : ‘Recognizing it to be an
everlasting virtue, O lord of monkeys,
implement the pledge given to me. Hurled
by my arrows to the other world, pray, do
not see you Vali in the abode of Death
today.” (84)
a पूर्वजं तीव्रविवृद्धकोपं

Perceiving his eldest brother, Sri Rama,
babbling, distressed as he was, his anger
having grown violent, Laksmana, the
promoter of the race of Manu (the progenitor
of mankind), who was endowed with terrific
energy, adopted a severe attitude towards
Sugriva, the ruler of monkeys. (85)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे
त्रिंश: GT: ॥ ३० Il
Thus ends Canto Thirty in the Kiskindhakanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a Rsi and oldest epic.
