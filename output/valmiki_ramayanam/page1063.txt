as meet for you, who have perpetrated an
offence against Sri Rama. (17)

नियुक्तैर्मन्रिभिर्वाच्यो gave पार्थिवो हितम्।
इत एव भयं त्यक्त्वा ब्रवीम्यवधृतं वच:॥१८॥

“A king indeed must be tendered salutary
advice by counsellors appointed for such
service. It is for this reason that, shedding
all fear of displeasing you, | tell you something
which has been carefully considered by
me. (18)

अभिक्रुद्ध: समर्थो fe चापमुद्यम्य wera: |
सदेवासुरगन्धर्वं वशे स्थापयितुं जगत्॥१९॥

“Raising his bow when enraged, Sri
Rama, a scion of Raghu, is surely able to
reduce to submission the whole universe
including gods, demons and Gandharvas
(celestial musicians). (19)

न स aa: कोपयितुं a: were: पुनर्भवेत्।
पूर्वोपकारं स्मरता कृतज्ञेन विशेषत:॥ २०॥

“He who deserves incessantly to be
propitiated is not fit to be provoked particularly

by a grateful soul who is alive to his past
obligations. (20)

तस्य Fat प्रणम्य त्वं सपुत्र: ससुहृज्जन:।
Tiers स्वसमये भर्तुर्भार्येव तद्वशे॥ २१॥

“Bowing low at his feet with your head
bent low, alongwith your son and near and
dear ones, O king, honour your understanding
with Sri Rama and remain subordinate to
his will as a wife to the will of her husband.

(21)
न रामरामानुजशासनं त्वया
कपीन्द्रयुक्तं मनसाप्यपोहितुम्।
मनो हि ते ज्ञास्यति मानुषं बलं
सराघवस्यास्य सुरेन्द्रवर्चस:॥ २२॥

“The command of Sri Rama and his
younger brother, Laksmana, O ruler of
monkeys, does not deserve to be flouted by
you even with your mind; for your mind
alone knows the superhuman might of Sri
Rama, who is glorious as Indra (the ruler of
gods), as also of Laksmana, a scion of
Raghu.” (22)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये किष्किन्धाकाण्डे

Thus ends Canto Thirty-two in the Kiskindhakanda of the glorious Ramayana of
Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.
