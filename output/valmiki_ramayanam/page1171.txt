Hanuman catches sight of Ravana reposing on an excellent couch decked
with various ornaments, himself adorned with jewels of every description.
Perceiving Mandodari graced with bright jewels and lying asleep on a
wonderful couch not far from her husband in the midst of dancing girls lying
in a disorderly state with diverse musical instruments clasped to their
bosom, and taking her to be Sita, Hanuman gets enraptured and exhibits his
joy through various simian gestures such as kissing the end of his tail.
Banishing by recourse to reason the thought that the lady whom he had
seen was Sita, Hanuman searches for Sita once more in the gynaeceum as
well as in the banqueting hall and sees there a number of women lying in
various states, as well as drinking vessels. He is seized with fear of having
incurred the sin of gazing on others’ wives; but the thought that he had
looked on them with a lust-free mind eases his conscience. .............00
Having failed to discover Sita even after searching for her in the picture
gallery and other places, Hanuman suspects that she might have been
disposed of by Ravana and, thus meeting with frustration, falls into the
quagmire of despair. On second thought, however, he deprecates despair
as harmful and, falling back upon self-reliance, resumes the search. But,
failing to find her even on searching for her all round, he becomes despondent

Coming out of the aerial car, Puspaka, and not finding Sita even on searching
for her on all sides, Hanuman concludes her to have been killed. Believing
that her untraceability, no matter whether it is reported to Sri Rama or not,
may lead to disastrous consequences, Hanuman decides not to return to
the mainland. Meanwhile, as he contemplates fasting till death or suicide or
the killing of Ravana, he catches sight of a grove which he does not
remember to have seen and before proceeding to explore it mentally invokes
the succour of Rsis and gods for success in his undertaking.................
Leaping down to the enclosure of the Asoka grove and watching the
loveliness of the grove from the top of the wall, Hanuman enters the grove
and, leaping from tree to tree in the course of his search for Sita, catches
sight of an Asoka tree. Espying a stream running beside it and expecting
that Sita might turn up on the bank of the stream to say her Sandhya
prayers, he takes up his position on that Asoka tree, hiding himself behind

Admiring the virtue and propitious bodily marks etc., of Sita, Hanuman
grieves at the thought of that lady, for whose sake Khara, Viradha and

other ogres were killed, having been reduced to such a sad plight. ................ 101

His eyes filled with joy on beholding Sita surrounded by ogresses with
hideous and deformed faces while the moon was at the meridian, Hanuman
mentally bows to Sri Rama and Laksmana and remains hidden behind the
