Keen to hear of Sita’s identity from her own lips, even though he had
identified her, Hanuman inquires of her whether she was a goddess or
anyone else and asks her to disclose her identity in case she was Sita. In
reply to this query Sita narrates to him her whole life-story ending with her

had ceased to love her, Hanuman attributes his non-appearance to his
ignorance about her whereabouts. Describing Sri Rama’s desolation in
order to betoken his excessive love for her, he consoles her with
the assurance that Sri Rama is sparing no pains to rescue her from her
