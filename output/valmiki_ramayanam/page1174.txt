Sita, who was distressed to hear of Sri Rama’s excessive grief caused by
his separation from her, implores Hanuman to bring Sri Rama at once to her.
Hanuman, who could not bear to see Sita’s sad plight, offers to carry her on
his back to the presence of Sri Rama and girds up his loins to do so. In order
to inspire confidence in Sita, who doubts his capacity to do it looking to
his small size, Hanuman assumes a gigantic form; Sita, however, declines
to go with him and urges Hanuman to bring Sri Rama to her. ......................... 170
Asked by Hanuman for a token, Sita narrates the episode of a crow, which
occurred on the Citrakuta mountain, and asks Hanuman to repeat the story
to Sri Rama by way of a token. She further sends her greetings both to
Sri Rama and Laksmana, conveys her inquiry after their welfare and
communicates to them her resolve to survive only for a month after the
expiry of the time-limit prescribed by Ravana; and last of all, she hands over
to him her jewel for the head aS 4 tOKeN. .........................................................- 176
Sita asks Hanuman, when the latter is about to depart with the jewel for her
head, to apprise Sri Rama and Laksmana of her own welfare and urge them
to rescue her. When Sita expresses her misgivings about the capacity of
the heroes on Sri Rama’s side to cross the sea, Hanuman expatiates on the
might of the monkey heroes and assures her of their ability to cross it, and
in the end consoles her by promising to bring Sri Rama and Laksmana on
his back across the S€a IN ANY CASE. ...............................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 183
Asking Hanuman, who was ready to depart, to remind Sri Rama of his
having once painted a decorative mark on her cheek with red realgar, and
also of how he threw a reed at the crow assailing her, destroying his right
eye thereby, as further tokens of Hanuman having met her, and urging him
to apprise Sri Rama of her wretched plight, Sita grants him leave to depart

Accounting his purpose not fully accomplished till he had ascertained the
strength of the ogres, even though he had received the message of Sita,
and making up his mind to lay waste the royal pleasure-garden as a means
of ascertaining the strength of the enemy, Hanuman proceeds to do it. .......... 190
Perceiving the devastation of the royal pleasance at the hands of Hanuman,
the ogresses keeping watch over Sita asked her who he was. On Sita’s
pleading her ignorance in the matter, some of them hurriedly seek the
presence of Ravana and report the matter to him. Hanuman makes short
work of a company of ogres known by the name of Kinkaras, despatched by
Ravana. Thereupon Ravana sends Prahasta’s son to punish the intruder. ..... 192
Having disposed of the Kinkaras sent by Ravana and making up his mind
to demolish the sanctuary sacred to the guardian deity of ogres, Hanuman
climbs it up and, killing the guards posted there, exhibits his prowess by
uttering the name of Sri Rama ina thundering voice. Nay, uprooting a
pillar of the sanctuary, he brandishes it and burns the sanctuary with the fire
produced ।18॥80. .........................................................--५५५५५५५५५५५५५१५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ० 196
