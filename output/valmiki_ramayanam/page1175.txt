Having made short work of the seven sons of Ravana’s chief minister too,

Dispatched by Ravana, Indrajit, Ravana’s eldest son, marches against
Hanuman. On his shafts being rendered ineffective by Hanuman through
his extreme agility, Indrajit takes him captive by discharging the unfailing
missile presided over by Brahma (the creator). Even though capable of
rendering it ineffective, Hanuman yields to its influence, eager as he was to
meet Ravana, to whose presence he is led by hiS SOM. ................................... 211
Wonderstruck to behold the splendour and glory of Ravana, Hanuman

Commanded by Ravana, Prahasta inquires of Hanuman as to who he was
as also his motive in devastating the royal pleasance and killing the ogres.
In reply Hanuman says that he destroyed the grove in order that he might
be taken captive and dragged to the presence of Ravana, whom he was
eager to see, and was compelled in self-defence to kill those who stood in
his way. In the end he declares himself to be a messenger of Sri Rama and
adds that, though protected against the missile presided over by Brahma,
he submitted to its influence only in order to be able to see Ravana. ............. 220
Narrating the story of Sri Rama from the latter’s entry into the forest, to his
own sight of Sita being borne away by Ravana through the air over the
Rsyamuka mountain, and celebrating the glory of Sf Rama, Hanuman
points out to Ravana that if he longed to survive he should restore Sita to
Sri Rama and that he should be prepared for the worst if, on the other hand,
he chooses not to part With NeP. ..............................................--५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 222
Provoked by the harsh words of Hanuman, Ravana orders him to be put to
death. Vibhisana, however, exhorts the latter to desist from this dastardly
act, pointing out that the killing of an envoy is forbidden by the Sastras. ........ 226
Wrapping up the tail of Hanuman in rags and soaking it in oil, and then
lighting it up, the ogres, as urged by Ravana, take Hanuman round the city
to the accompaniment of beat of drums. Hearing this news from the lips of
the ogresses, Sita prays to the god of fire on oath to see that Hanuman
remains unscathed. Climbing up the gate and shedding the fire by attenuating
his body, and then resuming vast proportions and seizing the iron bar of the
gate, Hanuman kills with it the ogres guarding the gate. ................................... 229
Making up his mind to set fire to the city of Lanka, which was the only work
left for him to do, and coming out into the open, Hanuman burns the entire
city barring the abode of Vibhisana. Astonished to see the city burning, the
gods and Gandharvas (celestial musicians) are filled with supreme joy. ......... 233
Seeing the whole of Lanka reduced to ashes and presuming Sita too to have
shared its lot, Hanuman begins to reproach himself and gets overwhelmed
with grief. In the meantime, he hears of her safety from the lips of Siddhas,
Caranas (celestial bards) and others and feels ८०॥110]180.. ............................... 238
