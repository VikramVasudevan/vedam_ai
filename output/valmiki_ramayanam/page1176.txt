Having leapt from the coast of Lanka and touching the Mainaka mountain,
which he came across in the way, nay, advancing further, Hanuman roars
at the top of his voice at the sight of the Mahendra mountain in order to bring
joy to the monkeys awaiting his return there. Jambavan tells the monkeys,
who got up impetuously on hearing the roar, that Hanuman has returned
successful from his expedition as was evident from his jubilant roar. Having
greeted Jambavan and others on alighting on the summit of the Mahendra
mountain, Hanuman narrates to them in a nutshell the story of his discovery
of Sita. Applauding Hanuman, Prince Angada, who was eager to hear the

story, sits down to do so on an extensive flat rock alongwith all. .................... 246

Enquired by Jambavan, seated alongwith the monkey hordes, Hanuman
narrates in extenso how he saw Mount Mainaka in the course of his journey
to Lanka, reached Lanka, beheld Janaka’s daughter and returned to Mount

Mahendra. ......................................................---५५५५ ५५११ १4११ ६4 १११4 ११११ १११६ १११५ ५ ८ 250

Picturing to his fellow monkeys the said plight of Sita, and feeling that it
behoved them all to see Sri Rama only after recovering Sita from Lanka,
nay, recounting the past heroic exploits of Jambavan and others, Hanuman

incites them all to have recourse to the arbitrament Of Wal. ............................. 263

Feeling encouraged by the tributes paid to his valour by his fellow monkeys,
Prince Angada undertakes to exterminate the entire ogre race including
Ravana and bring back Sita from Lanka. Jambavan, however, who is more
sagacious and practical-minded, discourages him by recourse to potent

Set out from the Mahendra mountain in the direction of Kiskindha, the
monkeys halt at Madhuvana, a grove guarded by the monkey Dadhimukha,
and most beloved of Sugriva, which falls on their way. When the monkeys
began to enjoy the fruits of the grove with the permission of Prince
Angada, Dadhimukha, comes in their way and is lacerated with their claws

Having entered Madhuvana and partaken of honey, as permitted by
Hanuman, and singing and dancing like drunken people, the monkeys were
forbidden by those guarding the grove and they belaboured the latter.
Repulsed by them, the guards reported the matter to their leader,
Dadhimukha, who appeared on the scene with his entourage and on
remonstrating with the monkeys was thrashed by Angada, who dashed him
to the ground. The guards headed by Dadhimukha then move en masse
to Kiskindha to report the matter to Sugriva and bow down at the latter’s

Having heard from the mouth of Dadhimukha the story of Madhuvana
having been laid waste by the monkeys, Sugriva concludes from
the jubilation of the monkeys that Sita has been traced out. Comforting

Dadhimukha, he asks him to send Angada and others without delay. ................. 275

Returning to Madhuvana as commanded by Sugriva, and craving the
forgiveness of Angada, Dadhimukha submits to the latter that he is urgently
