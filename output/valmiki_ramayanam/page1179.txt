On Sri Rama having crossed over to the other side of the sea, Ravana
commands his ministers, Suka and Sarana, to enter the enemy’s ranks and
tell him everything about them. Detected while doing the work of a spy, they
are captured by Vibhisana, but let go by Sri Rama. Going back to Ravana,
they exhort the latter to hand over Sita to Srl RAMA. ........................................ 379
Climbing up the roof of his palace on hearing the submission of Sarana and
surveying the entire army of monkeys, Ravana inquires about the monkey
leaders and Sarana shows to him Hanuman and others alongwith their

Mentioning the names of other monkey-generals, Sarana proceeds to

describe their individual VAlOUL. ............................................................................ 386
Suka completes the account given by S@rana. ............................................... 390

Snubbing Suka and Sarana, Ravana expels them from his court and
dispatches Sardula and other ogres for espionage. Captured by the monkeys,
the ogres are thrashed by them and get released by Sri Rama. Returning
to Lanka, they too speak to Ravana about the army of monkeys.................4. 394
Dispatched by Ravana to ascertain the strength of the simian army, the
ogre Sardula acquaints his master with the topmost leaders of the monkeys. ..... 397
Perturbed to learn from the spies sent by him that Sri Rama had taken up
his position near the Suvela mountain, Ravana takes counsel with his
ministers and, after dismissing them, approaches Sita with Vidyujjinva, who
was a past master in conjuring tricks. Telling her how her husband had been
killed by him with his entire army, he produces before her as an evidence
the counterfeit head of Sri Rama brought by Vidyujjihva. .................................. 400
Sita bursts into a wail at the sight of Sri Rama’s head and bow, when
Ravana is abruptly called away by an emissary and after consultation with
his ministers prepares his forces for action against the army of Sri Rama. .......... 405
Sarama reassures Sita by telling her that the head brought before her was
not of Sri Rama, who was alive and would soon be able to see her, and asks

her mot to 0० afraid. .............................................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 409

destruction of ogres, Malyavan exhorts Ravana to make peace with Sri
RAIMA... eee eee cc cece cece eee et eee eae teeta eee aa aeeaaaaaaaaeaaeaaanaaeeaeeeaeeeecceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeseeeeeeeeeeeeeeteetness 415
Deriding the exhortation of Malyavan, even though conducive to his good,
nay, holding consultation with his ministers and detailing Prahasta (the
Commander-in-Chief) and others to guard the four main gates against the
inroads of the enemy, Ravana complacently retires into his gynaeceum. ........ 419
While, on reaching the precincts of Lanka, Sri Rama and Sugriva as well as
other monkeys headed by Hanuman were deliberating as to how to achieve
success in their expedition, Vibhisana apprises them of the arrangements
made by Ravana at the four gates for the defence of Lanka, as reported to
him by his four ministers, who had entered Lanka in the disguise of birds and
witnessed everything with their own eyes. Sri Rama too after detailing
monkeys to storm the four gates climbs up the Suvela mountain with his
