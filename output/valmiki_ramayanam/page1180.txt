Climbing up the Suvela mountain in consultation with and in the company of
Laksmana and Vibhisana as well as of Sugriva and others, Sri Rama
surveys the city from that vantage-ground. The eminent heroes among the
monkeys too, who were eager to fight, roar at the top of their voice and

spend the night on the mountain itself with Sit RAMA. ....................................... 425

Having passed the night on the summit of the Suvela mountain, the
commanders of simian troops entered the parks and gardens in the outskirts
of Lanka, which were laden with blossom etc., while others make their way
into Lanka itself. Sri Rama, however, feels amazed to behold from the

mountain-top Lanka, which was charming in every reSpeCct. ............................. 427

Ascending the highest peak of the Suvela mountain alongwith a division of
his army, Sri Rama catches sight of Ravana perched on the top of a gate
of his palace. Infuriated at his very sight, Sugriva springs upon him by
surprise from the mountain-top, throws down the diadem from his head,
struggles with him for a long time and, eluding him, returns victorious to the

presence Of Sri RAMA. ......................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 430

Sri Rama is not very pleased with the daring act of Sugriva inasmuch as he
had seen evil portents. Warning him against such action on the ground of
his being a sovereign, and commanding the monkey generals to besiege all
the four gates of Lanka, he dispatches Angada to expostulate with Ravana
and bring him to reason. Angada tries his best to bring him round, but in vain,
and returns unsuccessful to the presence of Sri Rama after threatening the

Approaching Ravana, the ogres break to him the news about Lanka having
been laid siege to by the monkeys led by Sri Rama. Ascending the roof of
his palace and taxing his brain about the means of putting an end to the
monkeys, he casts a look at Sri Rama and the monkeys. Pained at the
thought that Sita was being bullied by Ravana on his account, and commanding
the monkeys to besiege all the four gates of Lanka and to destroy the ogres,
Sri Rama, on the other side, takes up his position alongwith Laksmana
near the northern gate. Apprised of these developments, Ravana mobilizes
his army and, encouraged by him, the ogres beat their drums and emit a

In the course of duels the ogres and the monkeys, in which Angada closes
with Indrajit, the heads of Durdharsa, Mitraghna, Agniketu and Yajhakopana
are lopped off by Sri Rama and that of Nikumbha by Nila and, killed by

During the nocturnal engagement the monkeys too dauntlessly offer a stiff
fight to the ogres even though they were fighting against heavy odds
inasmuch as the strength of ogres gets doubled at night, and felt highly
rejoiced to find Indrajit vanquished by Angada. Sri Rama and Laksmana
too put to flight numberless foes with their shower of arrows. Eventually,

however, they are both bound by Indrajit in a noose of ऽ8॥081]15...................... 451

Distressed to perceive the two scions of Raghu bound by Indrajit in a
network of arrows and pierced with other fierce arrows, the monkeys give

way to utter CESPONCENCY. ..........................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 455
