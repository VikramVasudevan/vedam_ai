Canto |

Desirous of reaching Lanka in order to discover Sita, Hanuman takes a leap
from a peak of Mount Mahendra and honouring with the touch of his hand
Mount Mainaka, which rose from the bottom of the sea to provide rest
on its peak to Hanuman, encounters Surasa (mother of Nagas), sent
by the gods in the form of an ogress, who was waiting for Hanuman
with her mouth open to devour him. He enters her belly
assuming a minute form and comes out without killing her.
Further, he is met by another ogress, Simhika by name,
standing with her mouth wide open to gulp Hanuman.

He enters her mouth after assuming a minute form
and comes out after splitting her belly open and
killing her. Then contracting his body into a
minute form again in order to preclude
the attention of the ogres, he descends
on a mountain peak outside Lanka

ततो रावणनीताया: सीताया: शत्रुकर्षण:।
इयेष पदमन्वेष्टुं चारणाचरिते पथि॥१॥

In order to discover the whereabouts
of Sita, who had been taken away by Ravana,
Hanuman, the scourge of his foes, wished
to course through the heavens, the path of
the Caranas or celestial bards. (1)

gat Potted चिकीर्षन् at ant
समुदग्रशिरोग्रीवो wat पतिरिवाबभौ॥ २॥

With his head and neck exalted,
Hanuman, the monkey chief, who sought to
accomplish without any other support a feat,
which was difficult for others to perform,
looked like a well-built bull. (2)

अथ वैदूर्यवर्णेषु शाद्बलेषु महाबल:।
धीर: सल्निलकल्पेषु विचचार यथासुखम्॥ ३॥

द्विजान् वित्रासयन् धीमानुरसा पादपान् हरन्।
मृगांश्च सुबहून् निघ्नन् was sa केसरी॥४॥
