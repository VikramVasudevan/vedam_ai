निशीथकाले रमणोपगूढा:।
ददर्श काश्चित् प्रमदोपगूढा
यथा विहंगा विहगोपगूढा:॥ १८॥

He further beheld some women who
shone brightly with their wealth of beauty
and character and were adorned with
bashfulness, who were embraced at dead
of night by their husbands like female birds
by their mates and were filled with excessive
joy. (18)

स्तत्र प्रियाङ्केषु सुखोपविष्टा:।
ud: परा धर्मपरा निविष्टा

The wise Hanuman saw still other
women, who were highly esteemed in the
eyes of their husbands, were devoted to
their duty towards their husbands and had
been lawfully married to them and were
possessed by love—perched on the roof of
their mansions and seated most comfortably
in the lap of their beloved ones. (19)

PUPATAAT ATT: ।
पुनश्च काश्चिच्छशलक्ष्मवर्णा:
कान्तप्रहीणा रुचिराङ्गवर्णा:॥ २०॥

Again there were some women
possessing the hue of a golden streak and
shorn of their outer garment, while some
other highly excellent women possessed
the hue of refined gold. Some more, who
had been disunited from their husbands,
were pale as the moon, though possessed
of a lovely complexion. (20)

The said Hanuman, the foremost hero
among the monkeys, then saw most charming
young women happy in their homes and
filled with great delight to meet their beloved
ones—who were highly pleasing to their
mind—and lovely with flowers on_ their
person. (21)

He also observed rows of faces shining
as the moon, nay, rows of shapely oblique
eyes with beautiful lashes and, even so,
rows of ornaments resembling charming
flashes of lightning. (22)
न wa oat परमाभिजातां

पथि स्थिते राजकुले प्रजाताम्।
लतां प्रफुल्लामिव साधुजातां
ददर्श तन्वीं मनसाभिजाताम्॥ २३॥

He, however, did not find anywhere the
frail Sita, sprung from the mind of the creator
and supremely high-born—descended as
she was in a royal house, the House of
Nimi, fixed on the path of virtue, and
resembling a lovely climber in full blossom.
