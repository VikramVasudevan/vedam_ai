दु:खोपहतश्चिरस्य
प्लवंगमो मन्द इवाचिरस्य॥ २७॥

Hanuman at once turned languid, as it
were, afflicted as he was with sorrow, on
not finding, even after striving for a long
time, the celebrated Sita, the consort of Sri
Rama, a ruler of men, the best of speakers,
Sita, who was firmly established in the eternal
path of devotion to her husband, who had
her eyes fixed on Sri Rama alone, who was
possessed by love for Sri Rama, who had
penetrated deep into the dignified mind of
her spouse and was ever exalted above all
other women; who was tormented with
anguish born of separation from her consort,
whose throat was choked with tears

incessantly flowing from her eyes, whose
neck was heretofore adorned with an
excellent gold ornament worthy of the
foremost, who was distinguished by beautiful
eyelashes, who had a charming throat and
when united with her spouse resembled a
pea-hen merrily dancing in a forest; who in
her soiled clothes and unclean person in
her captivity shone like the crescent with its
outline blurred due to its being screened by
a cloud or a streak of gold soiled with dust,
was prominent like a scar left by a wound
(serving as a reminder of the injury sustained
by Sri Rama in the shape of her abduction)
and who, while being carried to Lanka, shone
like the streak of a cloud swept by the wind.

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डे TAA: सर्ग: ॥५॥

Thus ends Canto Five in the Sundarakanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.

Canto VI

Reaching the palace of Ravana, which served as an adornment to Lanka, and
having looked for Sita in the adjoining mansions of Prahasta and others,
Hanuman now enters the palace of Ravana

a निकामं विमानेषु विचरन् कामरूपधूक।

Wandering in the midst of seven-
storeyed mansions, Hanuman, who was full
of riches in the form of strength and valour,
who was able to assume any form he chose
and was endowed with tremendous speed,
ranged over Lanka at will and reached the
palace of Ravana, the lord of ogres, enclosed
with a wall dazzling like the sun, nay, guarded
by terrible ogres as a huge forest by lions.
