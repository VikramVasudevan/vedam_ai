Canto VII

The poet incidentally draws a pen-picture of Ravana’s palace and his
aerial car known by the name of Puspaka

स वेश्मजालं बलवान् ददर्श
व्यासक्तवैदूर्यसुवर्णजालम् ।
यथा महत्प्रावरृषि मेघजालं
विद्युत्पिनद्धुं सविहङ्गजालम्॥१॥

The mighty Hanuman beheld the
collection of buildings comprising the palace
of Ravana to which were fitted lattices of
gold inlaid with cat’s-eyes, which was full of
flocks of birds and looked like a huge mass
of clouds pierced by lightning in the rainy
season. (1)

प्रधानशङ्खायुधचापशाला: ।
मनोहराश्चापि पुनर्विशाला
cast वेश्माद्रिषु चन्द्रशाला:॥२॥

He also observed various apartments
forming part of the buildings and stored with
excellent conches, bows and other weapons
and further saw_ soul-captivating and
commodious attics on top of the mountain-
like mansions. (2)

गृहाणि नानावसुराजितानि
सुपूजितानि।

देवासुरैश्चापि
सर्वैश्च ae: परिवर्जितानि
कपिर्ददर्श स्वबलार्जितानि॥ ३॥

Hanuman also beheld mansions
enriched with treasures of various kinds
and held in great veneration even by gods
and demons, which were completely free
from all sorts of flaws and which had been
acquired from the possession of Kubera by
dint of might. (3)

atm vwaatirenteah

मयेन साक्षादिव निर्मितानि।
महीतले सर्वगुणोत्तराणि

ददर्श लंकाधिपतेर्गृहाणि Ul ४॥

He saw those mansions of Ravana,
the suzerain lord of Lanka, which had been
disposed with great effort and had been
constructed, as it were, by Maya (the architect
of the demons, noted for his magical skill),
himself and which were superior on the
earth’s surface from the point of all
excellences.

ततो

श्रिया ad खे सुकृतं विमानम्॥७॥

He then beheld the excellent and soul-
captivating palace of Ravana, the suzerain
ruler of ogres, of incomparable loveliness,
nay, having the appearance of a towering
cloud and possessing the effulgence of gold
and worthy of his own extraordinary might,
which was heaven, as it were, descended
on earth and was blazing with splendour,
which was full of numerous precious stones
and strewn with the flowers of various trees,
which looked like the summit of a mountain
covered with pollen; nay, which was lit up
by jewel-like women as a cloud adorned
with flashes of lightning and looked like a
beautifully made aerial car full of splendour
and being drawn in the skies by excellent
swans. (5—7)
