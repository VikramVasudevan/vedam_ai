That prince among monkey-heroes,
Hanuman, saw in that palace the excellent
aerial car, Puspaka, which had been secured
by Ravana by dint of prowess acquired
through askesis and concentration of mind
on Lord Siva, which went wherever the

thought of its master directed it after
concentration of mind, nay, which had been
constructed according to specific models
and prepared with special, appropriate
materials collected from various places; which
moved swiftly following the mind of its master
and was difficult to approach for the sinful,
nay, which sped as swiftly as the wind and
could be occupied only by exalted souls
who had performed meritorious deeds and
acquired enormous merit of askesis, were
illustrious and enjoyed the foremost
happiness; which, having partaken of a
peculiarity of its own, had been shaped in a
peculiar fashion, which was a veritable
collection of curios and was adorned with
numerous apartments, which was _ soul-
captivating and bright as the autumnal moon
and looked like a mountain-peak with a
number of lovely, smaller pinnacles; which
was borne by hosts of genii, thousands in
number, whose faces were adorned with
earrings, who were voracious eaters and
had large rolling and unwinking eyes, were
endowed with tremendous speed, nay, who
travelled through space and ranged at night;
and which, with its bunches of vernal flowers,
was charming to look at and was lovelier
even than the vernal month. (4—8)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डेऽष्टम: सर्ग: ॥ Cll

Thus ends Canto Eight in the Sundarakanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.
