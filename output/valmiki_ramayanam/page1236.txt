Conquering Kubera by dint of his
superior physical strength, Ravana, the lord
of ogres, had won as a booty that heavenly
aerial car, Puspaka by name, which had
been constructed in heaven for Brahma, the
creator, by ViSwakarma, the architect of
gods and was embellished with all kinds of
precious stones, and which Kubera had
secured by virtue of his severest asceticism
from Brahma (the grandfather of the entire
creation, which was brought forth by his
mind-born sons, the Prajapatis). (11-12)

Hanuman, the mighty monkey, leapt up
the heavenly aerial car, Puspaka, which
was supported by well-fashioned pillars of
gold and silver, embellished with images of
wolves, and which was ablaze, as it were,
with splendour; which was graced on all
sides with secret cells and pleasure-houses,
resembling Meru and Mandara mountains,
brilliant as fire and the sun and scraping the
heavens, as it were; which had been
constructed well by Viswakarma, the architect
of gods, had stairways of gold and charming
and excellent platforms radiant with sapphires
and emeralds, was provided with lattice
windows of gold as well as of crystal, was
embellished on all sides with floors inlaid
with lovely coral and precious gems and
matchless pearls and which shone like the
rising sun painted as it was with the sandal,
bright as heated gold and emitting a pure
odour. Standing there, he smelt red heavenly
odour coming from drinks and foods including
cooked rice and diffused on all sides—
odour which impinged on him as though it
were solid air. That odour called, as it were,
Hanuman, who was-~ endowed with
extraordinary vitality, even as a relation would
call an esteemed relative, to the place where
Ravana was, saying ‘Come hither.’

Set out from there he beheld that well-
known, wonderful, spacious and cosy hall
which was the most beloved of Ravana as
