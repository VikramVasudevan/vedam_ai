नीलनागाभया वेण्या जघनं गतयैकया।
नीलया नीरदापाये वनराज्या महीमिव॥ Qu

Seated there, Hanuman, son of the wind-
god, surveyed the Asoka grove, which was
adorned with trees intertwined with Santanaka
climbers, and enriched with celestial odours
and delicious substances, and had been
decorated on all sides, and as such closely
resembled the Nandana grove in paradise,
which was full of animals and birds and
crowded with mansions and palaces and
resounded with the notes of cuckoos; which
was graced with large oblong wells containing
golden water-lilies, and lotuses furnished with
numerous seats and carpets and provided
with many-storeyed buildings, which was
embellished with lovely trees flowering in
every season, and laden with fruit and which
in virtue of the loveliness of ASoka trees in
blossom scattered the splendour of sunrise
and looked inflamed, as it were, and the
boughs of whose trees were being repeatedly
divested of their leaves, as it were, by birds
even as they flew away from them and again
perched on them. Adorned with wonderful
Asoka trees, which by virtue of their crest-
like flowers falling down in hundreds appeared
as though made of flowers from their very
roots and dispelled all grief—as well as with
Karnikara trees in blossom, which, bending
as they did under the heavy weight of their
clusters of flowers, seemed to touch the ground,
and with Kimsuka trees in full blossom, that
region was ablaze, as it were, on all sides
with their brilliance.

Numerous Punnaga and Saptaparna
trees as also Campakas and Uddalakas in
full blossom, whose roots had assumed great
dimensions, were spreading their charm in
that grove. Asoka trees stood there in
thousands, some of which shone brightly as
gold, others were resplendent as flames of
fire, while still others were dark as collyrium.
The Asoka garden was delightful as the
Nandana, the garden of gods, and lovely as
the Caitraratha grove of Kubera, nay, far
