Hanuman, the foremost of monkeys,
saw ogresses who were deformed, those
who were tawny, others who were dark-
complexioned, others who were irascible
and fond of picking up a quarrel and wielded
big darts, mallets and clubs of iron, some
with heads like those of a boar, deer, tiger,
buffalo, goat or fox, some with the feet of an
elephant, camel or horse, and others with
their heads sunk into their bosom (like
Kabandha), some with a single hand and
others with a single foot, some having ears
of donkeys and others those of horses,
some having the ears of a cow and others
those of an elephant, and still others those
of a lion, some having abnormally long noses
and others having crooked noses, and yet
others having no nose at all, some having
noses like the proboscis of an elephant and
others having noses for respiration fixed in
their foreheads, some having the feet of
elephants and others those of kine, some
having enormous feet and others having a
tuft of hair growing on their feet, some having
abnormally large heads and necks and others
having exceptionally large breasts and bellies,
some having unusually large mouths and
eyes, some having long tongues in their
mouths, also ogresses of terrible aspect
having the heads of goats, elephants, cows
or boars, horses, camels or donkeys, some
carrying pikes and clubs in their hands,
frightful ogresses who were irascible and
fond of picking up quarrels, had smoke-
coloured hair and deformed faces, who
constantly drank wine and were ever fond

of drink and meat, who lived on meat and
blood and had their bodies smeared with
meat and blood and whose very sight made
one’s hair stand on end and who were
seated close to and round about that tree of
beautiful trunk and boughs; and at the foot
of the same tree he beheld that irreproachable
and godlike princess. (9—18)

The graceful Hanuman found Sita,
Janaka’s daughter, who was shorn of lustre
like a meteor fallen on the earth, its merits
exhausted, was sore stricken with grief, her
locks thick with dirt, and rich in fame for her
lofty character, though deprived of the sight
of her lord, who, though bereft of her excellent
jewels, was nonetheless adorned with the
affection of her husband, nay, who, having
been detained by Ravana (the suzerain lord
of ogres) and as such disunited from her
relations, resemble a female elephant
separated from its herd, detained by a lion
and tied with a cord of affection for her own
herd, or the disc of the moon obscured by
autumnal clouds at the end of the monsoon;
who, through lack of contact with her
husband had got faded in appearance like
the untouched strings of a Vina by its master
and was reduced to a dumb state, not merited
