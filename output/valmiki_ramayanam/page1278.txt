Ravana, to his own destruction, sought
to cajole Sita, the princess of Mithila, who
resembled a great renown which has grown
dim, a faith which has been treated with
contempt, an understanding which has grown
feeble, a hope which has been frustrated, a
prospect which has been blasted, an order
which has been flouted, a quarter appearing
in flame at the time of some portentous
phenomenon, a worship which has been
tampered with, a full-moon night on which
the orb of the moon has been eclipsed by
the demon Rahu (darkness personified), a
lotus plant blighted by frost, an army whose
warriors have been killed, sunlight that has

111

been obscured by darkness, a stream which
has become thin due to drought, an altar
desecrated by an undesirable person, a
flame which has gone out, a lotus pond
whose lotuses with their leaves have been
pulled out, whose birds have been scared
away, nay, which has been rendered turbid
by the trunk of an elephant as well as
stirred by it; who was stricken with grief
caused by separation from her lord and had
grown lean and thin like a river whose water
has been diverted through canals etc., for
irrigation purposes and who, having been
deprived of excellent washing, resembled a
night during a dark fortnight; who was tender
and possessed of charming limbs and was
worthy of living in an abode full of precious
stones and looking like a lotus-root dug out
not long before and being baked in heat;
who resembled the female of a lordly elephant
disunited from the leader of the herd, nay,
captured and chained to a pillar and breathing
hard, sore stricken with sorrow, who looked
charming with a single long braid formed
without effort, even as the earth covered
with a dark row of trees at the end of a
monsoon when the clouds have disappeared;
who had been wasted, emaciated and
depressed through fasting, grief, brooding
and fear, lived on a meagre diet and was
rich in austerity; who was constantly asking
her deity mentally, as it were, with folded
hands for the discomfiture of Ravana, the
ten-headed monster, at the hands of Sri
Rama, the foremost of Raghus; who was
looking round weeping, irreproachable as
she was, had large reddish and white eyes
with beautiful lashes and was excessively
devoted to Sri Rama. (11—22)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डे एकोनविंश: AW: ॥ १९ ॥

Thus ends Canto Nineteen in the Sundarakanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.
