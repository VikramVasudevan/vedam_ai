Hearing of his five generals killed with
their followers and vehicles destroyed by
Hanuman, Ravana, the king, for his part
looked intently and inquisitively on Prince
Aksa, who stood face to face with him and
was violent in combat and inclined to fighting.

स तस्य दृष्ट्यर्पणसम्प्रचोदित:
प्रतापवान् काञ्चनचित्रकार्मुक:।
सदस्युदीरितो
द्विजातिमुख्यैर्हविषेव पावक:॥ २॥

Spurred on by his mere glance, the
glorious prince, who was armed with a
marvellous bow inlaid with gold, leapt up
forthwith in the royal assembly like a flame
fed with ghee by the foremost of Brahmanas
in a fire-sanctuary. (2)

ततो महान् बालदिवाकरप्रभं

Ta समास्थाय ययौ स वीर्यवान्
महाहरिं तं प्रति नैर्ऋतर्षभ:॥ ३॥

Mounting a chariot, effulgent as the
rising sun and overlaid with a protective
armour of highly refined gold, that eminent
and powerful jewel among the ogres
immediately marched against that mighty
Hanuman. (3)

दिवाकराभं रथमास्थितस्तत:
स निर्जगामामरतुल्यविक्रम:।॥ ६॥

Mounted on that chariot—which shone
like the sun, nay, which had been acquired

through accumulated practice of austerities,
had been rendered picturesque by a
protective armour of highly refined gold and
was decorated with small flags, which could
be distinguished by a bejewelled ensign, to
which eight excellent horses, swift as mind,
were firmly yoked, and was unassailable by
gods and demons alike, which could move
without any solid support and as such
coursed through the air, flashing like lightning,
was well fitted out and equipped with quivers,
which looked charming with eight swords
fastened to it (in the four quarters and the
four intermediate points), in which javelins
and lances had been placed in orderly array
and which shone brightly with all war
equipments strung together with a golden
cord brilliant as the rays of the sun and the
moon—Prince Aksa, who vied with gods in
prowess, presently sallied forth from that
place. (4—6)

स पूरयन् खं च महीं च साचलां
तुरङ्गमातङ्गमहारथस्वनै: ।
समर्थमासीनमुपागमत् कपिम्॥७॥

Nay, filling the firmament as well as the
earth including its mountains with the neighing
of horses and elephants and the rattling of
large chariots, Aksa, alongwith the collected
forces approached the powerful Hanuman
stationed on the archway. (7)
स तं समासाद्य at हरीक्षणो

युगान्तकालाग्निमिव प्रजाक्षये।
अवस्थितं विस्मितजातसम्भ्रमं
समैक्षताक्षो बहुमानचक्षुषा॥ ८॥

Hanuman, who stood ready for the
annihilation of ogres like the destructive fire
raging at the time of universal dissolution,
was astonished to see the prince, who was
a mere boy before him, arrived to give battle
to him. Hanuman was struck with wonder to

know that he was son of the great Ravana,
the said Aksa, whose eyes shone like that
