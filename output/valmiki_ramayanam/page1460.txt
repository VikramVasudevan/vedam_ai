Canto |

Hearing the report of Hanuman, and highly rejoiced at his having
done something worthy of a noble servant, which could
not be accomplished by anyone else, Sri Rama
applauds him and clasps him to his bosom

श्रुत्वा हनूमतो वाक्यं यथावदभिभाषितम्।
राम: प्रीतिसमायुक्तो वाक्यमुत्तरमब्रवीत्॥१॥

Filled with delight to hear the story of
Hanuman, faithfully narrated, Sri Rama
made the following appropriate reply: (1)

कृतं हनूमता कार्यं सुमहद् भुवि दुर्लभम्।
मनसापि यदन्येन न Mat धरणीतले॥ २॥
“A very great work, rare on earth, has
been done by Hanuman, which could not
be accomplished even in thought by
another on the earth’s surface. (2)

नहि तं परिपश्यामि aera महोदधिम्।
अन्यत्र गरुडाद् वायोरन्यत्र च हनूमत:॥३॥
“Indeed, | know of no other than Garuda
(the king of birds and the carrier of Lord
Visnu) and the wind-god and of no other
than Hanuman, who could cross the
expansive sea. (3)

देवदानवयक्षाणां गन्धर्वोरगरक्षसाम्।
अप्रधृष्यां पुरीं लङ्कां रावणेन सुरक्षिताम्॥४॥
प्रविष्ट: सत्त्वमाश्रित्य जीवन् को नाम निष्क्रमेत्।
को विशेत् सुदुराधर्षां राक्षसैश्च सुरक्षिताम्॥५॥
यो वीर्यबलसम्पन्नो न सम: Baa: |
एवं विधाय स्वबलं weet विक्रमस्य च॥६॥
“Having penetrated by dint of his
courage deeply into Lanka, which cannot
be taken violently even by gods, demons
and Yaksas nor by Gandharvas, Nagas
and ogres and is. well-protected by
Ravana, who else could actually escape
alive? Who can, in fact, even enter the
city, which is exceedingly difficult to
assail and is strongly guarded by ogres,
unless he is richly endowed with virility
and strength like Hanuman? Nay, a
momentous service has been rendered
