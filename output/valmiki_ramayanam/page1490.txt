# YUDDHAKANDA +

Dismissing them all on hearing the
submission of Vibhisana, Ravana, the

323

lord of ogres, retired to his own palace.

(23)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये FEROS TAA: सर्ग: ॥ ९ ॥
Thus ends Canto Nine in the Yuddhakanda of the glorious Ramayana of
Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.

दशम: सर्ग:
Canto X

Making his way into the palace of his eldest (half-) brother early next
morning and drawing his attention to the evil portents, Vibhisana appeals
to his good sense by making a timely submission

ad: प्रत्युषसि प्राप्ते प्राप्तधर्मार्थनिश्चय:।
राक्षसाधिपत्तेर्वेश्म भीमकर्मा विभीषण:॥ १॥

रत्नसंचयसम्बाधं भवनं भोगिनामिव॥६॥
तं महाभ्रमिवादित्यस्तेजोविस्तृतरश्मिवान्।
अग्रजस्यालयं वीर: प्रविवेश महाद्युति:॥७॥
After that, when the morning came,
even as the sun with its rays diffused
through their brilliance would penetrate into
a huge cloud, the heroic Vibhisana of valiant
deeds, who was clothed with extraordinary
splendour and who had ascertained the
truth about righteousness and material gain,
penetrated deep into the well-known palace
of his eldest (half-) brother, the suzerain
ruler of ogres, which looked like a mass of
crags, was lofty like a mountain top and

symmetrically divided into spacious
apartments; which was inhabited by a
gathering of learned men, superintended by
wise and devoted ministers and guarded on
all sides by trusted and competent ogres;
whose air was rendered tempestuous by
the breath of elephants in rut, which
resounded with a loud noise made by the
ogres, resembling the blast of conches and
was rendered noisy by the blare of trumpets;
which remained crowded with young women;
whose broad passages were noisy (with the
talk of passers-by) and which was provided
with gates of refined gold; which was decked
with the foremost of jewels and looked like
an abode of Gandharvas (celestial musicians)
or a mansion of gods; and which, abounding,
as it did, in collections of precious stones,
resembled a house of Nagas. (1—7)

पुण्यान् पुण्याहघोषांश्च वेदविद्धिरुदाहृतान्।
शुश्राव सुमहातेजा भ्रातुर्विजयसंश्रितान्॥८॥

There Vibhisana (who was clothed
with exceptional splendour) heard the holy
sounds of prayers wishing a propitious day
to the king and invoking the victory of his
eldest half-brother, uttered by the knowers
of Veda. (8)
