न यक्षगन्धर्वमहोरगेभ्यो

कथं नु रामाद् भविता wa नो
नरेन्द्रपुत्रात् समरे HTP
“Nor is there any fear to us on the field
of battle from Yaksas (a class of demigods),
Gandharvas_ (celestial musicians) and
eminent Nagas (serpent-demons) nor even
from birds and reptiles. How, then, can
there be any fear to us at any time on the
battlefield from Rama, the son of a ruler of
mortals?” (8)
प्रहस्तवाक्यं त्वहितं निशम्य
विभीषणो राजहितानुकाङ्क्षी।
at महार्थं वचनं बभाषे
धर्मार्थकामेषु निविष्टबुद्धि: ।। ९ ॥
Hearing the noxious braggadocio of
Prahasta, Vibhisana for his part, who was
a well-wisher of the king and whose
mind penetrated into the domains of
righteousness, material prosperity and
sensuous enjoyment, immediately made the
following speech, which was full of great
significance: (9)
Wet राजा च महोदरश्च
त्वं कुम्भकर्णश्च यथार्थजातम्।
ada we wa wt vert
यथा ofa: स्वर्गमधर्मबुद्धे:॥१०॥

“The actions which the king as well as
Mahodara as also yourself and Kumbhakarna
propose to take against Rama are not
capable of being accomplished by you any
more than the entry into heaven of one
whose mind is set on unrighteousness, O
Prahasta. (10)

वधस्तु रामस्य मया त्वया च

प्रहस्त सर्वैरपि राक्षसैर्वा।
भवेदर्थविशारदस्य

महार्णवं तर्तुमिवाप्लवस्य ।। ११॥

“How can the destruction of Rama,

ma

who is adept in achieving his object, be
compassed, O Prahasta, by yourself, myself
or even by all the ogres taken together any
more than it is possible for anyone to cross
the ocean without a bark? (11)

धर्मप्रधानस्य महारथस्य
इक्ष्वाकुवंशप्रभवस्य Wat: |
पुरोऽस्य देवाश्च तथाविधस्य

कृत्येषु WH भवन्ति मूढा:॥१२॥

“Even gods would feel nonplussed when
placed in front of the aforesaid king, Rama,
who gives the foremost place to piety, is a
great chariot-warrior, has taken his descent
in the race of Ikswaku, is a replica of the
latter in valour and other virtues and is
capable of accomplishing his objects. (12)

राघवविप्रमुक्ता:।
भि-च्वाशरीरप्रविशन्तिक्या
प्रहस्त तेनैव विकत्थसे त्वम्॥१३॥

“The sharp arrows furiously discharged
with vehemence by Rama (a scion of
Raghu), which are furnished with the feathers
of a buzzard and are dangerous to approach,
have not yet penetrated deep in your body
after piercing it. That is why you indulge in
boastful talk, O Prahasta! (13)
frat न तावत् प्रविशन्ति कायं

“The deadly and sharp arrows furiously
discharged with vehemence by Rama (a
scion of Raghu), which are equal in velocity
to the thunderbolt, have not yet made their
way deep into your body. That is why you
play the braggart, O Prahasta! (14)

न रावणो नातिबलस्तिशीर्षो
