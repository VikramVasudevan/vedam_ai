“After forcibly extracting his tusks
with a crash, the celebrated Airavata (the

trumpeting all the time, was actually dashed
to the ground by me and all the celestial
hordes were thrown into panic by me.

“How am |, who have crushed the
pride even of gods and brought grief even
to the foremost of Daityas, and am rich in

Hearing the aforesaid braggadocio

“You are indiscriminate, dull-witted,
