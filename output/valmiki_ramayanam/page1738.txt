विचेष्टमानो निजघान वृक्षा-
ज्शौलाञ्शिलावानरराक्षसांश्च ॥ १६०॥

When torn off, that arm of Kumbhakarna
which resembled a mountain (in size), fell
tossing about on the ground and crushed
under its weight many trees, crags, rocks,
monkeys and ogres, even as it fell.

at छिन्नबाहुं wet राम:
समापतन्तं सहसा नदन्तम्।
द्वावर्धचन्द्रौ निशितौ we
चिच्छेद पादौ af राक्षसस्य॥१६१॥

Beholding him rushing violently all at
once with a roar, both his arms severed,
and seizing hold of two sharp crescent
shaped arrows Sri Rama severed the ogre’s
feet as well on the battle-field. (161)

at तस्य पादौ प्रदिशो fer
गिरेर्गुहाश्चैव महार्णवं
विनादयन्तौ विनिपेततुश्च॥ १६२॥
The feet of the ogre also precipitately
fell down, making the four quarters as well
as the four intermediate corners, nay, even
the caves of the Trikuta mountain as also
the vast sea, the city of Lanka and the
armies of the monkeys and ogres resound
with the thud. (162)

Dilating his mouth, incandescent as
the submarine fire, the ogre, who had his
arms torn off and his feet, too, severed,
rushed vehemently, raising savage cries,
towards Sri Rama, even as Rahu would

towards the full-moon in the sky. (163)

Sri Rama filled his mouth with sharp-
pointed arrows provided with gold-encrusted
shafts. With his mouth fully packed, he
could not speak and even moaned with
difficulty and swooned too. (164)
अथाददे सूर्यमरीचिकल्पं

Wa: शरं मारुततुल्यवेगम्॥ १६५॥

The celebrated Sri Rama now took up
a sharpened arrow with charming feathers,
which was effulgent as a sunbeam, nay,
which resembled the rod of Brahma, the
creator, and the destructive Kala (Time-
Spirit), was fatal to the enemies, was charged
with a missile presided over by Indra, the
ruler of gods, and vied with the wind in
speed. (165)

Sri Rama discharged against the
prowler of the night that arrow, whose shaft
was inlaid with diamonds and gold, nay,
which was brilliant as the dazzling sun and
fire set ablaze and which resembled the
thunderbolt of the mighty Indra, and the
weapon Asani. (166)

Illumining the ten directions with its
effulgence, the aforesaid arrow, propelled
by the arm of Sri Rama, a scion of Raghu,
which was formidable of aspect like a
smokeless fire, flew with terrific speed, which
