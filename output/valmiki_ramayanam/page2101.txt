“The plea which you have given in the
words, ‘| am your daughter-in-law’ holds
good in the case of those who have only
one husband. Celestial nymphs have no
husband nor are gods committed to a single
wife; such is the eternal law obtaining in the
realm of gods.” Saying so and laying her on
the rock, the ogre, who was excessively
fond of gratifying his lust, started copulating
with her. Her ornaments of flowers having
fallen off in the course of the embrace,
Rambha felt disturbed in mind like a river
ruffled by the sport of a lordly elephant, and
was then let go by Ravana. With the ends
of her tresses dishevelled and tossed about,
and her hands, resembling tender leaves,
shaken, she looked like a creeper laden
with flowers and shaken by the wind.
Approaching Nalakubara with joined palms,
she fell at his feet, trembling with fear and
feeling abashed. Nay, seeing her reduced
to that condition, the magnanimous
Nalakubara said, “Blessed one, how is it
that you have fallen at my feet?” Trembling

and breathing hard, she for her part actually
proceeded with joined palms to relate to him
everything according to facts as follows:
“Ravana (the ten-headed monster) has
arrived on his way to heaven, my lord! The
night has been spent by him in the company
of his army here. While coming to your
presence, O scourge of your foes, | was
caught sight of by him. (39—47)

गृहीता तेन पृष्टास्मि कस्य त्वमिति रक्षसा।
मया तु Wa यत् सत्यं तस्मै सर्वं निवेदितम्॥४८ ॥
“Seizing hold of me, that ogre inquired
of me, ‘To whom do you belong?’ For my
part, all that was true was related by me to
him. (48)
काममोहाभिभूतात्मा नाश्रौषीत् तद् वचो मम।

Ae सर्वं पृष्ठत: कृत्वा बलात् तेनास्मि धर्षिता।
एवं त्वमपराधं मे क्षन्तुमर्हसि सुव्रत॥५०॥
“His mind being overpowered by
infatuation born of lust, he, however, would
not listen to that plea of mine. Disregarding
all that, O adorable one, even though he
was being appealed to by me in the words:
‘1am your daughter-in-law’, | was violated
by him perforce, my lord! You ought to
condone my fault committed in such
circumstances, O god of commendable
vows! (49-50)
