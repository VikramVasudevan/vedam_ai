Disconsolate over the death of her sons, Diti embarks on a course
of austerities at KuSaplava with the permission of her husband, Sage
Kasyapa, with the object of securing a son capable of killing Indra.
The latter on coming to know of her intention serves her during the
period of her consecration and, taking advantage of her falling asleep
on one occasion with her head in a wrong position, and thereby
transgressing the rules of purity, enters her womb and carves the
FOCTUS. .........................................................५५५५५ ७७११ ११११ ११११ १११५१११११११५५५१५५५५५५५५५५५ ५० 199
Viswamitra tells Sri Rama how on the very site of the grove where
Diti practised her austerities ViSala, a son of Ikswaku, built the city
of Visala. Sumati, the contemporary ruler of Visala, receives ViSwamitra
and his party as his distinguished छ85ऽ15…........................................................ 201
Having stayed overnight at Visala as an honoured guest of Sumati,
Sri Rama, accompanied by Viswamitra and the other sages, heads
towards Mithila (the capital of King Janaka) and, on reaching on the
way a deserted hermitage and, inquiring about it, is told by Viswamitra
how Ahalya, wife of Sage Gautama, whose hermitage it was, was
subjected to a curse by her husband. ................................................................ 203
At the intercession of the gods, Indra is supplied with testicles of a
ram; Ahalya gets back her pristine celestial form at the very sight of
Sri Rama, the moment he enters the hermitage, and the two divine
brothers are entertained by the lady with the help of her husband. ................ 206

Sri Rama and others reach Mithila and are received in advance by
King Janaka, headed by his family priest, Satananda; Viswamitra
satisfies their curiosity about the two princes of Ayodhya. ................................ 209
At the request of Satananda, Viswamitra tells him how Ahalya was
redeemed by Sri Rama and entertained him with the help of her
husband. And Satananda in his turn commences narrating to

Sri Rama the story of ViSWAMItIA. .........................…............. ८७७4 ७७७० 211
Vasistha enjoins his cow of plenty, Sabala by name, to yield
necessary articles for entertaining ViSWAMItIA. ................................................... 214

Heartily entertained alongwith his army by Vasistha with delicious
foods and drinks yielded by his cow of plenty, ViSwamitra asks
of him the cow, which Vasistha declines to part with. ....................................... 216

On Viswamitra attempting to take her away by force, Sabala seeks
to know Vasistha’s mind, and at his instance produces a multitude
of warriors that disperse ViSwamitra’S AFM). ...................................................... 218

His entire army having been exterminated by the warriors produced
by Sabala and his hundred sons reduced to ashes by the very roar
of Vasistha even as they assailed him, ViSwamitra retires to the
Himalayas for austerities and, receiving a number of missiles from
Lord Siva, tries them on the inmates of Vasistha’s hermitage;
Vasistha meets him with a mere staff appropriate to a
Brahman. ............ccccceccceeceeeceeee eee e eee e eects eae tae eaaeeaaaeaaeeaaseaeseesaneaaesaeeaaeeaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 221
