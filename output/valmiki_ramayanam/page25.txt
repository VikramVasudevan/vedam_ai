With his Brahmanical staff alone Vasistha renders ineffectual all the
mystic missiles discharged by ViSwamitra, whereupon the latter
condemns military strength and makes up his mind to practise

austerities with a view to attaining डिदचा)]00प. ............................................. 223

ViSwamitra embarks on a severe course of austerities with a view to
attaining Brahmanhood. In the meantime, King Trisanku of Ayodhya
requests Vasistha to conduct for him a sacrifice which may enable
him bodily to ascend to heaven and, on Vasistha declining to comply

with his request, approaches his sons for the Same [0॥[?058.. ......................... 226

Having been repulsed by Vasistha’s sons as well, Trisanku gets
ready to seek another priest, whereupon he is degraded by the curse
of Vasistha’s sons to the position of a Candala and approaches

ViSwamitra with the SAME reQUEST. .....................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 228

ViSwamitra assures TriSanku of his help, sends word to a number of
sages, inviting them to conduct a sacrifice for Trisanku, and pronounces

a curse on those Who deCliINE tO COME. ................................................५५५५५५५५५५ ० 230

At the instance of Viswamitra the sages assembled at his hermitage
commence a sacrifice; on the gods failing to appear at the sacrifice
to accept the offerings, Viswamitra sends TriSanku bodily to heaven
by dint of his own spiritual power, but the latter is expelled by Indra,
on which Viswamitra stops him in the air and proceeds to create a
new heaven and desists from his purpose only on the gods

Granting NiS GOSIFE. ..................................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५००५५ ० 233

The animal to be sacrificed at the sacrificial performance of King
Ambarisa having been stolen away by Indra appearing in disguise,
the arch-priest enjoined the king to secure a human beast as a
substitute. Wandering in search of such a beast, Ambarisa saw the
sage Rcika at Bhrgutunga and requested him to hand over his
juvenile son in exchange for a hundred thousand cows. On the
parents declining to part with their eldest and youngest sons, the
middle one, Sunahsepa by name, voluntarily offered himself for

being sold and the king returned with him to his capital. ................................. 236

On reaching Puskara, while Ambarisa is taking rest, Sunahsepa
approaches Viswamitra, who was practising austerities there, and
inquires of him a means of escaping death without meeting with the
king’s opposition, whereupon ViSwamitra teaches him a prayer each
for propitiating Indra and Lord Visnu, respectively, by reciting which
the boy secures release from Ambarisa’s bondage and the latter gets

the reward of the sacrifice without sacrificing NIM. ............................................ 239

Brahma pays a visit to Viswamitra at Puskara and rewards him with
the status of a Rsi (seer). There he feels enamoured of Menaka, a
celestial nymph deputed by Indra, and enjoys life with her for ten
years. At last he realizes his folly and retires to the Himalayas,
where he renews his austerities and is rewarded with the status
of a Maharsi by Brahma. Still dissatisfied, he prosecutes his

austerities with renewed VIQOUN. ..........................................-.५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 242
