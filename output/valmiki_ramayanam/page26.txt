Petrifying by means of a curse Rambha, the celestial nymph sent by
Indra to wean him from his austerities, Viswamitra resolves upon

a further course Of AUSTETILIOS. ............................................--.५५५५५५५५५५ ०

On Viswamitra not ceasing from his austerities even on his being
conferred the title of a Brahmarsi by Brahma, Vasistha, as urged by
gods, recognizes it and here ends the narration of Satananda. Having

worshipped ViSwamitra, King Janaka then returns to his palace......

On Viswamitra apprising Janaka of the eagerness of Sri Rama and
Laksmana to see his famous bow, Janaka reveals to him its glory
and tells him how he got it as well as Sita and also of his pledge to

give her in marriage to Sri Rama if he would string it. ......................

Urged by ViSwamitra, Sri Rama bends the bow, sent by Janaka to
the sacrificial hall, in order to string it and in the process breaks it,
whereupon Janaka with the concurrence of ViSwamitra sends his
counsellors to Ayodhya to invite Emperor DaSaratha for the wedding.
Reaching Ayodhya, the counsellors of Janaka tell Dasaratha how Sri
Rama broke the bow of Lord Siva in Janaka’s custody and won the
hand of his daughter, and convey to him their master’s invitation for
the wedding, on which DaSaratha makes up his mind in consultation

with Vasistha to depart for Mithila at an early पवांट. ...........................

With a large number of followers, DaSaratha proceeds to Mithila for
the wedding and is received with signal honour by Janaka

and his people and comfortably lodged. .............................................

Janaka sends for his younger brother, KuSadhwaja, from Sankasya.
Invited by him, DaSaratha meets Janaka at the latter's palace, where

at the instance of DaSaratha, Vasistha glorifies the race of Ikswaku. ..

Recounting his own pedigree, Janaka offers the hand of his two
daughters, Sita and Urmila, to Sri Rama and Laksmana, respectively.
Vasistha and Viswamitra jointly ask for the hand of the two daughters
of Kugadhwaja in favour of Bharata and Satrughna and Janaka
acquiesces in the proposal. Thereupon Dasaratha gets his sons to
perform the rite of Samavartana and himself performs the

NAndISraddha. .......................................................................................

Janaka escorts DaSaratha and his four sons clad in nuptial attire to
the pavilion erected for the wedding. Placing ViSwamitra and Satananda
ahead, Vasistha conducts the marriage ceremony. Sri Rama and his
three brothers clasp the hand of Sita and her sisters. Singing and
dancing for joy, the gods rain heavenly flowers on the brides and

Taking leave of Janaka and DaSaratha, ViSwamitra returns to his
own hermitage and, accepting large wedding presents, Dasaratha
too turns back to Ayodhya alongwith his sons and their newly-
wedded brides. On the way the irascible and redoubtable ParaSurama,
a sworn enemy of the Ksatriyas, suddenly appears before them, axe
in hand, and Vasistha and the other sages accompanying the

party offer worship to Ni. .........................................................५५५.५५.५५
