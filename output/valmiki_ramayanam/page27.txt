Turning a deaf ear to DaSaratha’s prayer, ParaSurama relates the
history of the bows belonging to Lords Siva and Visnu and challenges

Sri Rama to string the bow of Lord Visnu in his possession. ................

Fitting the arrow to the bow of Lord Visnu and declaring it as unfailing,
Sri Rama asks Parasurama to point out at whom it may be discharged,
and at the instance of the latter puts an end to his title to the
(ethereal) worlds earned by him through his austerities. Recognizing
Sri Rama to be no other than Lord Visnu and taking leave of him,
Parasurama withdraws to Mount Mahendra in order to resume

AIS AUSTETITIOS. .......................................--५५५५५५ ५१११ ११११ ६ 4 १११4 ११११ १4१ १६ ११११ ०

On the departure of Parasurama, Sri Rama hands over the bow of

Bharata having left for his maternal grandfather's capital alongwith
Satrughna, Emperor Dasaratha makes up his mind to install Sri
Rama as his Regent and, summoning a number of princes for

consultation, confers with them on the SUDJeCt. ......................................

DaSsaratha apprises the assembly of his intention to retire from
active rule after relegating the power to Sri Rama’s able hands and
the councillors with one voice ditto the proposal and urge the

Emperor to expedite matters. ...................................................५५५५५५५५५५७५५५ ४

Urged by the Emperor to solemnize the installation of Sri Rama as
Prince Regent, Vasistha enjoins in his turn Dasaratha’s ministers,
Sumantra and others, to get ready all requisites for the ceremony.
Sent by Sumantra, Sri Rama in the meantime calls on his father, who
announces his decision to install him as Prince Regent and also
tenders some opportune advice to him. Sri Rama’s chums break the
news to Sri Rama’s mother, Kausalya; treasuring in his mind the
exhortation of his father and bowing low to him, Sri Rama returns to

WIS OWN ApPartMeN. ..............................................५५५५५५५५५५१५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ४

Apprehending obstruction of Sri Rama’s installation from an ominous
dream, Dasaratha summons Sri Rama immediately and asks him to
observe certain sacred vows preliminary to installation alongwith
Sita. Bidding him go by his father, Sri Rama enters his mother’s
gynaeceum and, after receiving her blessings, retires alongwith Sita,

already present there, to his Own palace. ................................................

At the instance of the Emperor, Vasistha calls at Sri Rama’s palace
and instructing him alongwith Sita to fast for the night, returns to
DaSaratha. Permitted by the sage, the Emperor adjourns the assembly

and retires to the ए`/च48028],. ...............................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५०
