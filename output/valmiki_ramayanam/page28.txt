Enjoined by sage Vasistha, Sri Rama undertakes a vow to bathe
early next morning, worship the gods and sleep for the night on a
mat of KuSa grass. On waking up the next morning, he says his
Sandhya prayers and Brahmanas wish him a propitious day. The
citizens decorate the city in order to give it a festal appearance and
it is thronged with men eager to witness the installation of
Sri Rama as Prince ReQent. ................................................ व 306

Beholding the festivities and finding Kausalya bestowing large gifts of
money on the Brahmanas, Manthara, a hunchback hereditary maid-
servant of Queen Kaikeyi, who had accidentally ascended the roof of
the palace, inquires of Sri Rama’s erstwhile nurse the occasion for
the festivities and, on being told of Sri Rama’s forthcoming installation,
feels enraged and, approaching Kaikeyi, instigates her to stop the
installation. Kaikeyi, on the other hand, feels rejoiced over the news
and gifts her a jewel as a token of her PICASULE. .............................................. 309

While Manthara was thus trying to impress on Kaikeyi’s mind that the
installation of Sri Rama on the throne of Ayodhya would spell
disaster to Bharata, Kaikeyl for her part went on harping on Sri
Rama’s virtues and maintained that his installation as Prince Regent
was quite welcome to her. Manthara, however, goes on labouring her
point and urges Kaikeyi to interrupt the installation. .......................................... 312

Kaikeyi, whose heart was poisoned by the malicious gossip of
Manthara as aforesaid, takes a vow to see that Rama is sent into
exile and Bharata installed as Prince Regent, and asks Manthara
herself how to secure that consummation. Manthara tells her how in
the course of a conflict between gods and demons, in which
DaSaratha’s help was enlisted by the gods, the queen, who had
accompanied her husband to the field of operations and had rendered
valuable assistance to him at a critical juncture, was offered a couple
of boons, which she had kept in abeyance. Manthara now asks
Kaikeyi to demand the banishment of Rama and the installation of
Bharata against the two promised boons. Kaikeyi accordingly throws
away her ornaments and lies down on the bare floor in the sulking-

Having told off Sumantra and others to get together necessaries for
the installation of Sri Rama, Dagaratha calls on Kaikeyl to break the
happy news to her. Not finding her in her apartments, however, he
makes inquiries from the portress, who tells him of her presence in
the sulking-chamber. The Emperor calls on her there and, lifting

Egged on by Kaikeyi to grant her desire, DaSaratha gives his word
of honour to her to that effect. Invoking the presence of gods as
witnesses and reminding the Emperor of what took place during the
conflict of gods and demons, Kaikeyi asks of him the two boons
promised by him in the shape of exiling Sri Rama for a period of
fourteen years and installing Bharata as Prince Regent. ................................... 326
