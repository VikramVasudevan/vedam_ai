Canto |

Bharata having left for his maternal grandfather's capital alongwith Satrughna,
Emperor Dagaratha makes up his mind to install Sri Rama as his Regent
and, summoning a number of princes for consultation, confers
with them on the subject

गच्छता मातुलकुलं भरतेन तदानघ:।
शत्रुघ्नो नित्यशत्रुघ्नो नीत: प्रीतिपुरस्कृत:॥१॥

(As has already been stated in verses
17—19 of the foregoing Canto) the sinless
Satrughna, the destroyer of the lasting
enemies (concupiscence etc.), was taken
away on that occasion by Bharata while the
latter was proceeding to his maternal uncle’s
home, full of affection as he (Satrughna)
was for Bharata. (1)

स तत्र न्यवसद् Wat सह सत्कारसत्कृत:।
मातुलेनाश्वपतिना पुत्रस्नेहेन लालित:॥ २॥

Entertained with hospitality by his
maternal uncle, Yudhajit, an owner of
horses, and fondled with parental affection,
he tarried there (in his maternal grandfather's
house) with his younger brother, Satrughna.

(2)

तत्रापि निवसन्तौ dt तर्प्यमाणौ च कामत:।

Continuing there and even though being
gratified with desired objects, the two gallant
brothers thought of their aged father, King
DaSaratha. (3)

राजापि at महातेजा: सस्मार प्रोषितौ सुतौ।
उभौ भरतशत्रुघ्नौ महेन्द्रवरुणोपमौ॥४॥
The highly glorious Emperor too
remembered both his aforesaid sons, Bharata
and Satrughna, who vied severally with the
mighty Indra, the ruler of gods, and Varuna,
the god presiding over the waters, and were
away from their home. (4)
