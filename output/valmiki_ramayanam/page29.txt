Extolling the virtues of Sri Rama and showing him undeserving of
exile, the Emperor endeavours to dissuade Kaikeyi from her pertinacity
in sending Sri Rama into exile. Quoting the examples of Harigcandra
and others, Kaikeyi, however, redoubles her insistence. The Emperor
for his part rebukes her in harsh words and goes the length of falling

at her feet in order to bring her round but in Vain. ........................................... 329

Further tormented by Kaikeyi through her importunity to have the
boons granted by the Emperor implemented, the latter piteously wails
his lot and reproaches her. The sun having set in the meanwhile, the
Emperor continues till the following morning his solicitations to Kaikeyi
to allow Rama to be installed as Prince Regent. But, Kaikeyi remaining
adamant, the king in his extreme anguish of mind sinks down
unconscious on the floor and, on regaining his consciousness,
stops all music pertaining to the occasion of the king’s quitting

Citing other instances of the Emperor’s fidelity to truth and threatening
to lay down her life in the event of his not carrying out her wishes,
Kaikeyi insists on his sending Sri Rama into exile at once and does
not desist from her purpose even when railed at by her husband. In
the meantime Sumantra makes his appearance in the gynaeceum
and, extolling the Emperor, reminds him of his intention to install Sri
Rama as Prince Regent and eventually leaves the gynaeceum in

order to summon Sri Rama at the instance of the Emperor. ............................ 342

While going out of the gynaeceum to bring Sri Rama, Sumantra sees
Vasistha and others as well as a number of kings waiting at the
gate and hastens back to announce their presence to the king. He
is, however, sent back to fetch Sri Rama and forthwith enters

the latter's apartment. ..............................................--५५५५५५५५५५११५५५५५५५१११५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 348

Seeking the presence of Sri Rama, Sumantra communicates to him
the Emperor's command asking Sumantra to bring Rama with him,
and departs. Mounting his gold chariot and accompanied by Laksmana,
who holds an umbrella over the formers head and waves a pair of
chowries in order to fan him, and followed by a number of elephants
and horses, Sri Rama drives in state to see Dagaratha, listening

en route to his own glory sung by jubilant men and women. ............:::cee eee 353

Sri Rama drives in state to his father’s gynaeceum, beholding
en route the charms of Ayodhya, hearing the blessings and encomia
of his friends and relations and ravishing the eyes of all on-lookers,
and on reaching his destination sends back his retinue and seeks

the presence of his royal father AlONC. ............................................................... 357

Questioned by Sri Rama as to what preyed on his father’s mind,
Kaikeyi tells him all that had happened in the meantime and

sternly urges him to depart for the WOOUS. ......................................................... 359

Having agreed to leave for the forest, Sri Rama proceeds to

take leave of his mother KauSalya. ......................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 363
