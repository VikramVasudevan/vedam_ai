Even as Sri Rama issued forth from the palace of Queen Kaikeyi, the
inmates of the gynaeceum burst into a piteous wail, extolling the
prince’s virtues. Mother Kausalya embraces and pronounces her
benedictions on Sri Rama as the latter approaches her and falls at
her feet. On being apprised of the circumstances that had brought
him there, she falls to the ground overwhelmed with grief, and weeps

bitterly expressing her GEep ऽ०॥0५. ......................................................५५५५५५५५५५५० 367

Consoling Kausalya in her grief over the impending exile of Sri Rama,
Prince Laksmana opposes the idea of Sri Rama’s leaving for the
forest and, censuring DaSaratha, makes up his mind to accompany
his eldest brother. Kausalya too deters Sri Rama from going into
exile, branding Kaikeyi’'s command as unjust. Sri Rama, however,
justifies the command on the ground of its being countenanced by the
Emperor and requests his mother to grant him leave and perform

auspicious rites connected with Nis Aeparture. ................................................... 372

Sri Rama pacifies Laksmana, who was angry with Kaikeyl, by
denying the instrumentality of Kaikeyi in his banishment and laying

the entire blame On NiS OWN fate. ...................................................-.५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ५ 379

Enraged to hear the exhortation of Sri Rama, Laksmana urges in
reply that the word of their father was worth ignoring inasmuch as it
was divorced from righteousness and, further emphasizing the
predominance of personal effort over destiny, persuades Sri Rama to
take up arms against those who interfere with his installation and
occupy the throne of Ayodhya by force. Sri Rama, however, pacifies
Laksmana and impresses on him the imperative necessity of their

carrying out the command of their father. .......................................................... 382

Finding Sri Rama firm in his obedience to the command of his
parents, Kausalya (Sri Rama’s mother) urges him to take her
alongwith him. On being told, however, that it was incumbent on a
matron whose husband was alive to remain with the latter and

serve him, she consents to Sri Rama’s departure to the forest. ...................... 386

Having received the mother’s benedictions for the journey, Sri Rama
falls at her feet and proceeds to the apartments of Sita in order

Beholding Sri Rama depressed in spirits and lustreless with frustration
writ large on his countenance, Sita, who knew nothing about the
interruption of his installation and had been eagerly and joyfully
awaiting his return, inquires about the cause of his dejection and is
told how his installation has been stopped and how he is going to be
sent into exile by his father, and exhorted to look after her father-in-
law and mothers-in-law as before and to treat Bharata and Satrughna
as her own brothers or sons and never to harbour malice

Exhorted by Sri Rama to stay in Ayodhya to look after his parents,
Sita submits in reply that she being his counterpart, her exile is
implied in his and insists on her being taken with him since she

would not be able to bear Separation from DIM. ................................................. 398
