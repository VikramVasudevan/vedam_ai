Bringing home to Sita the austerity and hardships of forest life,
Sri Rama tries once more to dissuade her from her insistence on

accompanying him to the fOreSt. ...................................................-.५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 400

Sita continues to implore Sri Rama to take her to the forest alongwith
him. Sri Rama, however, is adamant and goes on consoling her

and asking her to stay on in Ayodhya. ............................................................... 403

Though consoled by Sri Rama in many ways, Sita did not change her
mind and seeing her insistent on accompanying him, Sri Rama
agrees to take her to the forest and asks her to prepare for the

journey and to give away all her personal belongings in charity. .......................... 405

Hearing the dialogue of Sri Rama and Sita, Laksmana seeks his
permission to accompany him to the forest. Sri Rama desires him to
stay in Ayodhya in order to look after his mothers. But seeing his
insistence, he agrees to take him as well and urges him to bring
Suyajfia and other Rsis, accounting them worthy of receiving gifts

Having received gifts of jewels and ornaments from Sr Rama and
Sita, Suyajfia invokes divine blessings on the couple. Enjoined by Sri
Rama, Laksmana then bestows silk costumes and ornaments etc.,
on the sons of Sage Agastya and others. Urged by his wife, a sage,
Trijata by name, approaches Sri Rama and seeks riches from him.
Sri Rama thereupon bestows on him thousands of cows and distributes
his remaining wealth among other Brahmanas as well as among his

relations and ॥2[08]प475.. ......................................................…५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ४ 413

Having distributed his immense riches among the Brahmanas and
others, Sri Rama, accompanied by Sita and Laksmana, proceeds to
his father’s gynaeceum to take leave of him. Remaining unruffled
even on hearing en route the diverse talks of the citizens gathered
here and there, with melancholy writ large on their faces, the royal trio
reach their destination and urge Sumantra to apprise their royal

father 0 their Arrival. ..........................................-...५५५५ ५५५१ १५ १११4 ११4१ १६4१ १ 4१११ १५१५५५५ ० 418

Apprised of Sri Rama’s arrival by Sumantra, Dagaratha commands
him to usher in Sri Rama with his consort. Seeing the Emperor fall
unconscious at the very sight of the heir-apparent, the ladies of the
royal household start wailing piteously. On Sri Rama’s soliciting his
permission to retire to the woods, the king enjoins him to take his
father captive and ascend the throne. Sri Rama in his turn consoles
his father by assuring him that he has no hankering for royal fortune
and that to him obedience to his father’s command is of utmost
importance. DaSaratha, however, falls unconscious again at the very
thought of his separation from Sri Rama, and Sumantra as well as

all the ladies of the gynaeceum follow SUit. ......................................................- 421

Hoping that by being provoked to anger Kaikeyi might come round
and relax her insistence on sending Sri Rama into exile, Sumantra
harshly reproaches her, reminding her of her mother’s misbehaviour
towards her husband (Kaikeyi’s father). Kaikeyi, however, remains

adamant and does not budge even an inch from her ?॥[0?0568.......................... 427
