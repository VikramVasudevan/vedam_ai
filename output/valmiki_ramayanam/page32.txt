36. Dasaratha instructs Sumantra to take a detachment of the army and
the exchequer alongwith Sri Rama, to which Kaikeyl objects and
insists on his being sent into exile without any resources on the
analogy of Asamafija, son of the king’s forefather, Sagara. Another
minister of the king, Siddhartha by name, who was present there,
opposes Kaikeyi and urges that the analogy of Asamanja, who was
a perverse lad, could not be applied in the case of Sri Rama, who
possessed an ideal character and deserved in every way to be
installed in the office of Prince Regent. In the event of Kaikeyi
vetoing the proposal, the king threatens to accompany the

37. Sri Rama urges his servants to fetch the bark of trees for being used

as his wearing apparel. At this Kaikeyi herself brings them the

desired dress, which both Sri Rama and Laksmana cover themselves

with, taking off their princely robes. Sita, however, finds it difficult to

wear the bark supplied to her and ultimately puts it on over her own

dress with the help of Sri Rama despite the remonstrances of

Vasistha, who severely castigates Kaikeyi for her cruelty in

38. Incensed to hear the loud wailing of those present at the scene, on

Sita being dressed as a hermitess, DaSaratha reproaches Kaikeyl.

While departing, Sri Rama entreats his father to take care of

39. Sent away by Dasaratha, Sumantra gets a chariot ready to take Sri

Rama and his party to the forest and Sita adorns herself with jewels

brought by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Kausalya tenders

opportune advice to her daughter-in-law and the latter bows to it. Sri

Rama comforts Kausalya and offers apology to his other mothers,

40. Going clockwise round Dasaratha (as a token of respect), Sita,

Rama and Laksmana greet him. Accompanied by Sita, Sri Rama

salutes Kausalya. Laksmana too hails Kausalya first and then his

own mother, Sumitra. Sumitra for her part tenders salutary advice to

her son. The princes and the princess having mounted the chariot,

Sumantra flicks the horses. The citizens that had assembled, closely

follow the chariot; but unable to keep pace with its swift movement,

they return desolate. DaSaratha too runs after the chariot alongwith

Kausalya and others, but being unable to walk begins to totter and

stops short on the road yielding to the remonstrances of his
