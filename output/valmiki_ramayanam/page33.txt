Sri Rama having departed for the forest in an exceptionally swift-
going chariot, DaSaratha vainly seeks to cover the intervening
distance on foot. The very dust raised by the chariot having disappeared
after a while, the Emperor feels doubly disconsolate and drops to the
ground. When Kaikeyi comes forward to support him, he scolds her
and asks her not to touch his person. Kausalya then lifts him up and
persuades him to return. His personal attendants take him to the
latter's apartments and, seeing him plunged in grief, Kausalya seats

herself beside him and begins to lament in variOUS WAYS. ............................... 450

in eloquence, assuages Kausalya’S fief. ........................................................... 455

When the citizens that followed Sri Rama in his journey to the forest
refuse to return even when pleaded by Sri Rama in many ways,
unable as they were to bear separation from him, Sri Rama, with Sita
and Laksmana, gets down from his chariot and begins to walk. The
citizens try to deflect him from his course and persuade him to
return, but in vain. At the close of the day they all reach the bank

0 THE TAMASA. ..................................................---५५५५५ ५११५ ११६१ १११4 ११4१ १६११ १६ ११११ १५५००५५ ० 458

Having reached the bank of the Tamasa and thinking of the plight of
the people of Ayodhya, Sri Rama lays himself down on a bed of
leaves bewailing the lot of his parents and feeling reassured by the
thought of Bharata’s noble qualities; while Laksmana opens his
dialogue with Sumantra on the divine excellences of Sri Rama.
Waking up in the meantime, Sri Rama urges the charioteer-minister
to drive the chariot in such a way as to put the citizens, that had
accompanied them, off the scent and lead them to think that the
chariot had turned back towards Ayodhya instead of proceeding
towards the forest. He then mounts the chariot alongwith Sita and

Laksmana and presses on to the forest. ............................................................ 462

The citizens that had followed Sri Rama in his journey to the forest
woke to find Sri Rama and his party gone and begin to reproach
themselves. Overcome with grief they hunt up the tracks of his
chariot; but unable to find them, they helplessly return to Ayodhya

Told of Sri Rama’s departure for the forest by the citizens, who had
gone out with Sri Rama and returned, unable as they were to find out
the tracks of his chariot, their wives reproach Kaikeyi and break

Having covered a long distance in the meantime, Sri Rama
finishes his morning bath and devotions and, having crossed the
Vedasruti, Gomati and Syandika rivers, presses forward talking with
