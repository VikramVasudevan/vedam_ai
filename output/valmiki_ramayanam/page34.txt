Standing with his face turned towards Ayodhya, Sri Rama bids
farewell to his birth-place and, sending back the people hailing from
the countryside, who had come to see him, and crossing the frontiers
of Kosala, Sri Rama reaches the bank of the holy Ganga. Alighting
from the chariot under an Ingudi tree standing on the bank, he goes
forward to meet Guha, the chief of the Nisadas, who had come to
meet him. Nay, worshipping the evening twilight and taking water
only (for food and drink), the prince lies down on the ground to repose
for the night; while Sumantra, Guha and Laksmana spend the night

talking tOQethelr. ...................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५११५५५५५११५१११५५११५११५५५ ० 473

Expressing his readiness to guard the Crown prince and his consort,
keeping awake the whole night, Guha importunes Laksmana to
repose. Reminding Guha of Sri Rama’s greatness, Laksmana, however,
tells him that even though the duty of guarding his princely brother
and his consort could as well be entrusted to Guha, he felt that he
did not deserve to lie down in the presence of his elder brother and
sister-in-law and preferred to remain awake. Expressing grief for his
royal father and loving mothers he therefore spends the night talking

While about to step into the boat brought by Guha’s men and asked
by Guha if he could be of any further use to the prince, Sri Rama
enjoins him to obey the Emperor. Importuned by Sumantra to take
him as a personal attendant to the forest, the prince declines his
loving offer and, expostulating with him, sends him back to Ayodhya.
Entangling their locks into a thick mass with the milk of a banyan
tree, procured by Guha, Sri Rama and Laksmana with Sita get into
the boat. On reaching the middle of the stream, Sita offers prayers
to Mother Ganga (the deity presiding over the stream) and after
crossing the river all the three halt for the night at the foot

Apprehending trouble for Kausalya and others at the hands of
Kaikeyi, Sri Rama, who was seated at the foot of a banyan tree and
was a past master in the art of persuasion, persuades Laksmana to
the best of his ability to return to Ayodhya. Laksmana, however,
pleads inability to survive in his absence and does not budge an
inch from his resolution to stay with his eldest brother. Sri Rama,
therefore, yields and sets his seal to his continuing with him during

Set out on his journey for the Dandaka forest with Sita and Laksmana,
Sri Rama reaches at dusk the hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja in the
vicinity of the confluence of the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
Paying due honours to Sri Rama and his party, the sage recommends
Citrakuta as the fittest place for him to sojourn in. Spending the night
in discourses on various topics with him, the sage grants him leave

early next morning to depart for Citrakuta. ......................................................... 494
