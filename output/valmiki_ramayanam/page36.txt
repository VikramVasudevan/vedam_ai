Waking from sleep after a while and recalling his sinful deed, which
spelt death to him, Dasaratha proceeds to tell Kausalya how, while
he was Prince Regent of Ayodhya, he went out a-hunting in the
forest one day and heard during the last watch of the night the sound
of a hermit boy filling his pitcher with water by submerging into
Sarayu river. Mistaking the gurgling sound for the trumpeting of an
elephant, DaSaratha hit the boy with an arrow, which dug deep into
his body and mortally wounded him. On approaching his quarry he
discovered the fatal blunder and tendered his heartfelt apology to the
hermit boy, who asked him to extract the arrow from his body and
report the matter to his aged parents. The boy died immediately the

arrow was taken out Of NiS DOCY. ....................................................................... 523

DaSaratha continues to tell Kausalya how, having sought the presence
of the aged parents of the deceased, he apprised them of the sad
incident and escorted them to the river bank, where their son lay
dead; how, clasping the boy to their bosom, they both piteously
wailed and offered libations of water to his spirit for its benefit; how,
invested with an ethereal body, the spirit ascended to heaven while
consoling the aged couple and finally how, having cursed the king
that he too would meet his death in his agony of separation from his
son, the ascetic couple gave up the ghost and attained the Supreme.
Having thus related the story of his imprecation and loudly lamenting,
the Emperor breathes his last with the thought of Sr Rama

When the Emperor did not wake up even though roused by means
of panegyrics sung by bards, accompanied by musical instruments
played upon for the same purpose, the ladies of the gynaeceum
conclude by other means that the king is dead; and soon after

commences the loud wail of Kausalya, Sumitra and other queens. ................ 535

Resting the head of the lifeless monarch in her own lap and severely
reproaching Kaikeyi, Kausalya grievously mourns for Sri Rama and
other exiles. Holding back Kausalya—who was lamenting with her
arms placed round her deceased husband’s bosom—and consigning
the Emperor's dead body to a trough filled with oil, the ministers and

other functionaries return each to his own abode in the evening.................6+ 538

Attributing the rise and fall of a kingdom to the presence and
disappearance of its ruler, Markandeya and other great sages, who
attended the king’s court the following day, urge Vasistha to

install any of the princes on the throne immediately. ........................................ 541

With the concurrence of Markandeya and other sages, Vasistha
despatches messengers to call back Bharata and Satrughna from
their maternal grandfather's. They leave forthwith for the capital of

Kekaya and quickly enter that City. ...............................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 544

Finding Bharata oppressed and sad, his friends try to beguile him by
means of music and narration of stories. But when the prince does
