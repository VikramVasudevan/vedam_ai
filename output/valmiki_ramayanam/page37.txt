not return to his normal mood even then, they inquire of him as to
what makes him pensive and Bharata tells them how he saw a

bad dream the previoUS NiQht. ...................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ४ 547

While Bharata was narrating to his friends the dream seen by him
the previous night, the messengers from Ayodhya arrive in his
presence and, bowing low to Bharata, communicate to him the
orders of Sage Vasistha. Having heard of the welfare of all from the
mouth of the messengers, the prince takes leave of his maternal

grandfather and others and departs for Ayodhya. .............................................. 549

When Bharata reaches Ayodhya after crossing many streams and
rivers and passing through different territories and finds the city
cheerless and wearing a deserted look, he sets about brooding and
speculating as to what may be the reason for this and, speaking
to the charioteer about it, enters the palace dejected and

Entering his father’s apartments and not finding him there, Bharata
moves to his mother’s apartments and, having communicated to her
the welfare of his maternal grandfather and others on being questioned
by her, inquires of her the whereabouts of his father. Kaikeyi then
breaks to him the news of his father’s death, attributing it to Sri
Rama’s exile and holding herself responsible for the latter, and after
comforting him calls upon him to get himself installed on the throne

after finishing his father’s ODSEQUIES. ...................................................-५५५५५५५५५५५५० 556

Bitterly reproaching Kaikeyi in many ways, and cutting her to the
quick by his caustic remarks, Bharata takes a vow before her to bring
back Sri Rama from the forest, install him on the throne of Ayodhya

and wait upon him as an attendant to offend ॥8॥. .............................................. 561

Severely reproaching his mother once more, and making up his mind
not only to bring back Sri Rama from the forest and crown him king,
but also to go into exile for fourteen years in order to redeem his
elder brother’s vow; Bharata, who is filled with rage at the thought of
the mischief wrought by his mother, cannot contain his grief

and falls UNCONSCIOUS ON the QrOUNd. .........................................................५..५५५४ 564

Swearing that what had already come to pass in the shape of exile
of Sri Rama, Sita and Laksmana and the resultant death of the King-
Emperor was not to his liking, Bharata moves with Satrughna to the
apartments of his stepmother, Kausalya, who speaks unkindly to him
taunting him with the remark that his mother, Kaikeyi, had rendered
good offices to him by securing for him the kingdom of Kosala,
sought after by him. Bharata, however, politely denies on a number
of oaths all complicity in the machinations of his vile mother. Thereby
coming to know of his heart, the guileless Kausalya places Bharata

on her lap and weeps Ditterly. ..................................................---५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 568

Removing his fathers dead body from the vessel full of oil
and cremating it with the help of articles befitting an Emperor, and
