Having performed with the help of Satrughna all the obsequial rites
relating to his deceased father on the twelfth day after his death,
Bharata gifts to the Brahmanas abundant gold and jewels as a part
of the obsequies. Overwhelmed with grief on reaching the funeral
pile in order to pick up the principal bones of the deceased on the
thirteenth day, the prince drops to the ground. Rolling on the ground,
Satrughna for his part wails in profusion. Comforted by Vasistha and
Sumantra, the two brothers urge the ministers to expedite
the work of picking UP the DOMES. ....................................................५५५५५५५५५५५७५५५५५ ८ 577
While Bharata is contemplating to undertake a journey to meet Sri
Rama, Satrughna blames Laksmana for failing to restrain his father
and forcibly prevent Sri Rama’s exile. In the meantime Bharata
catches sight of Manthara standing at the door decked with ornaments
and points to her as the root of all mischief. Satrughna thereupon
pounces upon the maidservant standing in the midst of her companions
and, seizing her by her locks, drags her on the floor and reproaches
Kaikeyi too. On the latter pleading for mercy on Manthara’s behalf,
Bharata intervenes and Satrughna lets Ner QO. ...................................…......... 580

On the fourteenth day the foremost of counsellors entreat Bharata to

The King’s bards, panegyrists and minstrels having commenced
eulogizing Bharata in the customary way in the midst of festal music
at sunrise the following morning, Bharata stops it, disclaiming
sovereignty, and complains to Satrughna of the ill—turn done to the
world by his own mother. In the meantime Sage Vasistha enters the
royal court and sends messengers to Bharata urging him to be
present in the court; and in response to his call Bharata, accompanied
by Satrughna and others, enters the ASSEMBLY. ................................................ 587

Sage Vasistha urges Bharata to accept the kingdom bequeathed to
him by his father and elder brother. Bharata, however, scornfully
declines the offer and takes a solemn pledge to depart for the forest
and try his level best to bring his elder brother back to Ayodhya. At
his instance Sumantra gets a chariot ready to take him to the forest
and brings the chariot to iS PreSONCe. .................................................५५५५५५५५५५५० 589
