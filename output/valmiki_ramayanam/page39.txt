Leaving the capital early next morning, accompanied by the family-
priests, artisans, army and the citizens, and covering a long distance,
Bharata reaches the bank of the holy Ganga at Srngaverapura ruled
by Guha and, encamping the army, breaks journey in order to do
Sraddha and Tarpana in honour of his deceased father on the bank

of the Ganga and also to give rest to his followers. ......................................... 593

Scenting mischief in the mind of Bharata, who was taking a large
army with him, Guha orders the ferrymen to guard the boats so as
to prevent Bharata’s men from crossing the Ganga, and himself
seeks the presence of Bharata in order to know his mind. Being
satisfied about his good intention, he entertains Bharata and his men
with fruits and roots etc., brought by him and, on his having taken

rest awhile and overcome his fatigue, allows him to 20४छा102........................... 595

Highly praising Guha, Bharata, while departing, inquires of him the
way to the hermitage of Bharadwaja. Promising to follow the prince
as a guide with his servants and placing his misgivings before him,
Guha seeks to know his intentions about Sri Rama and consoles

the prince, who was constantly bewailing till QUSK. ............................................ 597

Guha reports to Bharata how Sri Rama and his party broke their
journey at Srngaverapura and reproduces before him the dialogue
that took place between Laksmana and himself at night and further
tells him how the two brothers entangled their locks into a thick
mass, crossed the holy river with Sita and left for the hermitage

Overwhelmed with grief to hear from the mouth of Guha how his two
brothers got their hair entangled into a mass, Bharata falls unconscious
on the ground. On regaining consciousness he despatches Guha to
reassure mother Kausalya, who is filled with apprehension about the
safety of Sri Rama and his party on hearing of Bharata’s swoon, and
apprise her of its real cause and also of Sri Rama’s welfare. While
doing so Guha also tells her how Sri Rama and Sita lay down on a
bed of KuSa grass prepared by Laksmana with his own hands when
the party broke journey at Srngaverapura and how Guha with
Laksmana kept watch the whole night for the protection of Sri Rama

Showing to Kausalya and others the bed of Kuga grass on which Sri
Rama and Sita spent their night, and contrasting it with the royal
splendour and luxury in which he lived in Ayodhya, Bharata laments
for him and, holding himself responsible for this turn of events and
complimenting Laksmana and Sita for throwing their lot with Sri
Rama and sharing his privations, makes up his mind henceforth to
dwell in the forest as a representative of Sri Rama, wearing matted
