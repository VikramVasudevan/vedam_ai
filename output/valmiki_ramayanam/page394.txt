Nay, having finished the sacred rite of
invoking blessings on Sri Rama with due
ceremony, Kausalya whose eyes were
overflowing with tears, further went clockwise
round Sri Rama (a scion of Raghu) and,
gazing on him again and again, embraced
him. (46)

Circumambulated clockwise by the said
pious lady and pressing as a token of
reverence his mother’s feet again and again,
that highly illustrious scion of Raghu,
irradiated as he was by the splendour
occasioned by the mother’s benedictory rites,
proceeded to Sita’s apartments. (47)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्येऽयोध्याकाण्डे पञ्चविंश: सर्ग: ॥ 24 ॥

Thus ends Canto Twenty-five in the Ayodhyakanda of the glorious Ramayana of
Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.

Canto XXVI

Beholding Sri Rama depressed in spirits and lustreless with frustration writ
large on his countenance, Sita, who knew nothing about the interruption
of his installation and had been eagerly and joyfully awaiting his
return, inquires about the cause of his dejection and is told how
his installation has been stopped and how he is going to be
sent into exile by his father, and exhorted to look after her
father-in-law and mothers-in-law as before and to treat
Bharata and Satrughna as her own brothers or sons
and never to harbour malice towards them

अभिवाद्य तु कौसल्यां राम: सम्प्रस्थितो वनम्।
कृतस्वस्त्ययनो मात्रा धर्मिष्ठे वर्त्मनि स्थित:॥ १॥
विराजयन् राजसुतो राजमार्गं नरैर्वृतम्।
हृदयान्याममन्थेव जनस्य गुणवत्तया॥ २॥

Saluting Kausalya while about to set
out for the forest, Sri Rama, for his part, on
whom blessings had been invoked by his
mother and who stuck to the most righteous
path, agitated as were the hearts of the
people that had gathered there, through his
richness in excellences of various kinds,
illumining at the same time by his very
proximity the king’s highway crowded with
men anxious to have a look at the prince.

Sita, a princess of the Videha territory,
in her turn, who had been observing austere
vows, had not so far heard all that had
happened in the meantime, causing
interruption in the installation of Sri Rama
and making for his exile into the forest, so
that the aforesaid installation alone of Sri
Rama in the office of Prince Regent stood
foremost in her heart. (3)

देवकार्यं स्म सा Hal कृतज्ञा हृष्टचेतना।

Having offered worship to the gods,
the celebrated princess, who knew her duty
