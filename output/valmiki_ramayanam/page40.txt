Having encamped his followers including the army, that were ferried
across the Ganga by the fishermen enjoined by Guha, Bharata sets
out with Sage Vasistha and others to the hermitage of Sage

Bharadwaja with intent to see the latter. ............................................................ 607

Leaving his party a couple of miles away on this side of the
hermitage, Bharata enters it with Vasistha and Satrughna. After
exchange of compliments between Sages Vasistha and Bharadwaja,
Bharata bows down at the feet of the latter, who inquires of his health
and seeks to know his mind about Sri Rama. Bharata thereupon
remorsefully apprises him of his intention to bring Rama back from
the forest and questions him about his whereabouts. To this the sage
replies that Sri Rama was sojourning on Mount Citrakita, and

advises Bharata to see the latter the following morning. ................................... 610

The hospitality shown by Sage Bharadwaja, who had acquired rare
mystic powers by virtue of his austerities, to Bharata, his army and
entourage, the kind of which could not be shown even by a

ruler of the entire QlODe. ...........................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५ ४ 613

Questioned with folded hands about the road to Citrakuta, Bharadwaja
shows the way to Bharata and then inquires of him about the names
of his three mothers, who stood bowing down to the sage. Having
told him the names of all the three of his mothers with the history of
each, and commanding the army to get ready for the journey ahead,

Bharata proceeds to CitrakUta with his retinUe. ................................................. 620

Setting his foot on the soil of Citrakuta with his army and camp-
followers, and identifying the place with the help of the features
pointed out by Bharadwaja, Bharata commands the army men to
look out for the hermitage of Sri Rama. Pursuing their search they
perceive smoke at some distance and concluding the site to be the
hermitage of Sri Rama, Bharata enjoins his army to halt and makes

up his mind to walk with Vasistha and others to that place. ............................. 624

Diverting his own mind and seeking to please Sita, Sri Rama gives

a graphic description of Citrakuta, stressing the special features. ................. 627

In order to humour Sita, Sri Rama gives a description of the river

While recreating himself in the company of Sita on the lovely hills of
Citrakuta, Sri Rama beholds all of a sudden a large cloud of dust
screening the sun and hears a loud noise and despatches Laksmana
to ascertain the cause. Laksmana thereupon climbs up the top of a
lofty tree and catching sight of an army with the chariot of its leader
distinguished by an ensign bearing the device of a Kovidara tree,
hastily concludes that Bharata has come all the way to dispose of Sri
Rama and thereby to make himself secure on the throne of Ayodhya.
Returning apace to the presence of Sri Rama he disburdens himself
of his suspicions and speaks angrily about Bharata, swearing that he
