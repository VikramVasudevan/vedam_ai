97. Pointing out to Laksmana who was waxing indignant at Bharata, the

impropriety of killing the latter, Sri Rama pacifies him by assuring him

of the pious intentions of Bharata. Ashamed of himself to hear the

opinion of his brother about Bharata, and climbing down the tree,

Laksmana hides his shame by changing the topic. Commanded by

Bharata, who was anxious to avoid causing disturbance to the

hermitage occupied by Sri Rama, the army encamps_ round-

98. Telling off Guha and Satrughna with their followers to find out the

hermitage of Sri Rama, Bharata himself, who was keen to see Sri

Rama, goes out in search of his hermitage with the ministers,

walking all the way and envying the good fortune of Sita and

Laksmana, who were living with Sri Rama; and reaching the foot of

a sala tree and concluding the place from the presence of smoke

nearby to be a human habitation and ruling out the possibility of any

other human being living in that lonely forest, he eagerly hastens

forward in the hope of meeting Sri RAMA. ......................................................... 638
99. Requesting Vasistha to fetch his mothers and pressing forward,

Bharata reaches the hut, made of leafy twigs, in which the three

exiles were living. While attempting to hail Sri Rama, Sita and

Laksmana on seeing them, he stumbles down even on an even

ground, his eyes getting bedimmed with tears at the sight of their

ascetic garb. Sri Rama hastens to lift him up and clasps him to

his bosom. Sumantra and Guha as well meet Sri Rama and

LAKSIMANA. ...... ee cee cece eee e ec ee cece cette tae e eae aaa eaaeeaasaaaaeaaaeaaecaaecaeceececeeeeeeeeeeeseeeeeeeeeeeerees® 640

101. Questioned as to what made him give up the sovereignty of Ayodhya

and enter the forest in the garb of an ascetic, Bharata reproaches his

mother and implores his elder brother to accept the kingship and

return to Ayodhya. Sri Rama, however, pleads that the command of

their father is supreme and must be implicitly obeyed by both of

them, the first part of it enjoining the exile of the elder brother being

binding on him and the second part bequeathing the kingdom to

Bharata being binding on the latter. ....................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 652

102. Bharata tells Sri Rama that, having been deprived of the privilege of
serving his elder brother, he will have nothing to do with sovereignty
and requests him to offer water to the spirit of his deceased father,
who died with the thought of Sri Rama alone foremost in his mind,
and further implores him to get himself consecrated for the sovereignty
of Ayodhya, the obsequies of their imperial father having been
duly performed by the two brothers, Bharata and Satrughna, at
