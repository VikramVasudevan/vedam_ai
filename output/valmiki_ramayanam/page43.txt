109. Jabali explains the reasons for his advocating the theory of Nastikas

to Sri Rama, who exposes the hollowness of the ethics propounded

by the sage, dubbing it as the very antithesis 0 ।)]वि।।व . ............................... 676
110. Pacifying Sri Rama, who had got angry with Jabali, Sage Vasistha

urges him to get himself consecrated as king since from Ikswaku,

the progenitor of his race, downward the eldest son alone had

ascended the throne of Ayodhya and because he was not only

the eldest of his father’s sons, but the ablest too. ............................................. 681

111. Pleading the superiority of a teacher in comparison to one’s parents,
Sage Vasistha by virtue of his superiority and as a concession to
Bharata, a dependant of Sri Rama, whose vow it has been to respect
the feelings of his dependants, urges Sri Rama to grant the prayer
of Bharata: Sri Rama, however, contends that one’s parents are
more worthy of respect even than one’s teacher and is accordingly
insistent on implementing the pledge already given by him to his
father. Thus discomfited in argument, Bharata makes up his mind to
undertake a fast unto death as a last resort to exert pressure on him.
On Sri Rama’s dubbing such a step as repugnant to the code of
conduct prescribed for a Ksatriya, Bharata requests his elder brother
to allow him to remain in exile in the forest as the latter’s proxy.
Sri Rama, however, rules out this proposition also as something
preposterous, saying that one’s duty is entrusted to a proxy only on
the former's incapacity, which could not be predicated of him, and
reaffirms his dicision to enter Ayodhya only after fulfilling the
pledge given to his father. ......................................................--५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 685

112. Collected in the heavens to hear the dialogue of Bharata and Sri
Rama, heavenly beings applaud the two brothers. Having decided
upon his course of action, Sri Rama turns his face towards his hut;
while pleading his inability to protect the kingdom, now that his
attempts to take Sri Rama back to Ayodhya had been frustrated,
Bharata prays to Sri Rama for mercy once more. But when he comes
to know that his elder brother cannot be made to swerve an inch
from his vow, he places a new pair of wooden sandals decked with
gold in front of his brother and requests him to place his feet on
them. Readily acceding to his request, Sri Rama hands over the
sandals to Bharata, who takes a vow before the former to enter the
fire in case he did not return immediately on the expiry of his term of
exile. Sri Rama confirms his vow and after embracing Bharata and
Satrughna and bidding good-bye to all with due respect according to
the rank of each, enters NiS COtAGE. ......................................................५५५५५५५५५५० 689

113. Departed back for Ayodhya alongwith Sage Vasistha and others,
Bharata pays his respects on the way to Sage Bharadwaja and,
