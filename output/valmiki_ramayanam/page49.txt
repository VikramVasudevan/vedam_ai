a human being, Sugriva offers his hand for being clasped by Sri
Rama as a token of friendship. Sri Rama responds by clasping it with
his own and hugs him to his bosom. Their friendship having been
solemnized in the presence of a fire, Sugriva narrates to him his tale
of woe and requests Sri Rama to get rid of Vall, his hostile brother.

Telling Sri Rama that he had come to know from Hanuman all about
his misfortune (in the shape of the abduction of his wife) and
assuring him that he will have her traced out wherever she may be
and restore her to him, Sugriva fetches from inside his cave an
ornament tied in a corner of a silk wrapper and dropped by her from
the air while being carried away by Ravana, and shows it to Sri
Rama. Recognizing it as belonging to Sita alone, Sri Rama is plunged
once more in grief born of separation from his beloved spouse and,
violently hissing like a serpent, impatiently inquires who that Ravana
was and where from he hailed. ................................................................५५५५५५५५० 953

Consoled by Sugriva with the assurance that, even though ignorant
of the abode of that vile ogre who bore away Sita, he would see that
Sri Rama is reunited with her; Sri Rama compliments him and
promises to kill Vall. ...................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५११५५५५५५५५११५५५५५५५५५५५ ० 955

Congratulating himself as well as his near and dear ones on his
having secured the friendship of Sri Rama, and sitting on a common
bough alongwith the latter, Sugriva seeks protection from Vali. Dilating
once more on the wrongs done to him by Vali in the shape of
wresting his wife and so on, he solicits Vali’s death at the hands of
Sri Rama. Asked to account for this hostile attitude of Vali, Sugriva
proceeds to relate the circumstances which led 10 it. ....................................... 958

Sugriva tells Sri Rama how challenged to a duel at dead of night by
a demon, Mayavi by name, who owed him a grudge on the score of
a woman, Vali sallied forth with Sugriva and, following at the heels of
the demon, who ran away on seeing him, and reaching the mouth
of a cave asked Sugriva on oath to stay out, himself entering the
cave. Since Vali did not come out for a whole year and as from a
confused din coming out of the cave as well as from a stream of
blood issuing from it, it was concluded that Vali had met his death
at the hands of the demon, Sugriva closed the mouth of the cave
with a rock and, offering water to the spirit of his deceased elder
brother, returned to Kiskindha, where the ministers of Vali installed
him on the latter’s throne in his absence. In the meantime Vali
returned from the cave and reprimanded Sugriva for his having
