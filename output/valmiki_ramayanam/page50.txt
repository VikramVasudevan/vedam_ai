With a view to ascertaining Sri Rama’s actual strength, Sugriva
expatiates on the prowess of Vali and tells him how Mayavi’s
brother, the demon Dundubhi too challenged him to a duel and how,
having made short work of him, Vali listlessly hurled his dead body
crossing over to the precincts of the hermitage of Sage Matanga, and
how the site of the hermitage having been desecrated with blood,
spattered here and there from it’s mouth, Sage Matanga pronounced
a curse forbidding the individual who had perpetrated the sacrilege to
enter the hermitage on pain of death, thus enabling Sugriva to live
unmolested in that retreat. In order to convince Sugriva of his
superior might Sri Rama kicks the skeleton of Dundubhi away with
his toe. Belittling this feat on the ground of the skeleton having
shrunk as a result of exposure, Sugriva further asks Sri Rama to
pierce with his arrow one of the seven sal trees standing there and

thus demonstrate his Strength. ...............................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 968

Amazed to behold Sri Rama’s arrow re-enter his quiver after piercing
all the seven sal trees and penetrating the bowels of the earth, and
applauding Sri Rama, Sugriva implores him to make short work of
Vali. Sending Sugriva to challenge Vali to a combat, Sri Rama sits in
hiding behind a tree. When a passage at arms commenced with Vali
who would not brook a challenge, Sr! Rama did not hit Vall with an
arrow because the two brothers so closely resembled each other that
it was difficult for him to distinguish one from the other. The result
was that Sugriva lost heart and ultimately taking to his heels, returned
to Rsyamuka. Explaining to Sugriva the reason of his failure to hit
Vali, Sri Rama reassures Sugriva and encourages him to seek an
encounter with Vali again. Urged by Sri Rama, Laksmana uproots a
blossomed Gajapuspi creeper and ties it about the neck of Sugriva

While going to Kiskindha alongwith Sugriva and others with intent to
make short work of Vali, Sri Rama sees a delightful grove and
inquires of Sugriva as to whose hermitage it was. Sugriva tells him
in reply that the hermitage belonged to a group of sages known by

the name of Saptajanas, who had bodily ascended to heaven. ....................... 980

Sri Rama and others remain hiding behind the trees of a grove in the
vicinity of Kiskindha, Sugriva implores Sri Rama to implement his
vow of killing Vali. Assuring Sugriva that this will be done, Sri Rama
encourages the latter to go and challenge his elder brother

and Sugriva does aAcCCOrdinglly. ............................................................-.५५५५५५५५५५५५.८ 982

Angrily issuing forth for an encounter on hearing the roar of Sugriva,

Vali is discouraged with cogent reasons by his wife, Tara. .............................. 985

Spurning the advice of Tara and reproaching her, Vali goes forth to
meet Sugriva and there ensues a fierce encounter between the two
brothers. When, however, Sugriva is found losing ground, Vali is

struck with an arrow by Sri Rama and he falls to the ground. ......................... 988
