Still retaining his life and vital energy by virtue of the gold chain
bestowed on him by Indra, though pierced in the breast with a deadly

arrow, Vall indignantly reproaches Sri Rama in many WaYS. ............................ 991

Sri Rama justifies his action by saying that the punishment meted out
to Vali in the form of taking his life was meet, having regard to the sin
of depriving his own younger brother of his wedded wife, of which
Vall was guilty. Repenting for his having reproached Sri Rama, Vall
now seeks the latter’s forgiveness and requests him to take care of

his son, Angada. Agreeing to do so, Sri Rama comforts VAIL. ......................... 997

Agonized with grief to hear about the death of her husband, Tara, wife
of Vali, sallied forth from Kiskindha to arrive in the presence of Valli.
Fleeing helter-skelter through fear of Sri Rama and meeting Tara on
the way, the monkeys try to send her back inspiring fear in her and
advise her to make arrangements for the defence of the city and
install Angada on the throne. Rushing to the scene of contest after
dismissing them, Tara catches sight of Vali lying on the ground,

as well as of Sri RAMA ANA OFhELS. ................................................................. 1003

Clasping Vali to her bosom and wailing piteously for the sake of

Angada, Tara resolves upon a fast unto ट्वा. ............................................... 1006

Comforting Tara, who was lamenting through a variety of expressions,
Hanuman urges her to have the obsequies performed in respect of
the departed soul by Angada and attend to the earthly good of
Angada. Tara, however, refuses to flinch from her resolve and
prefers to follow her husband to the other world rather than bestow

any thought on the earthly welfare of her SON. ................................................ 1008

Craving the forgiveness of Sugriva, though he was younger than
he, and applauding the resolve of Tara (to follow her husband), nay,
urging Sugriva to follow the advice of Tara, look after Angada
affectionately and accomplish the purpose of Sri Rama, Vali asks
Sugriva to take off the gold chain from the former’s neck, and gives
up the ghost while tendering wholesome advice to Angada. Extolling
the wonderful exploits of Vali, hordes of monkeys lament in many
ways. Stricken with agony caused by separation from Vali, Tara falls

to the ground, EMbracing VAIN. ..................................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५७५५५५ ४ 1010

Though endeavouring, after smelling Val’'s face, to embrace him,
Tara finds herself unable to do so, bathed as he was in blood and
daubed with dust. Nila pulls out Sri Rama’s arrow from his heart

and, urged by Tara, Angada bows down at his feet. ...................................... 1013

Beseeching Angada and others to conduct the search for Sita,
Sugriva, whose heart melted to hear the laments of Tara, seeks Sri
Rama’s permission to enter fire to atone for Vall’s death, making Sri
Rama sad. Approaching Sri Rama in her turn, Tara extols him with
devotion and expresses her intention to give up the ghost, on which
Sri Rama expostulates with her and urges her to survive for

the earthly good Of ANAQada. .....................................................................५५५.. ८ 1016
