Sri Rama consoles Sugriva and others. Entrusting Sugriva with the
work of getting firewood for the cremation of Vali, Laksmana asks
Tara to arrange for a palanquin to carry Vali in state to the
crematory. Placing the dead body of Vall as commanded by Sri
Rama on the palanquin brought by Tara, Sugriva and others carry
the palanquin to the riverside and, taking it down on a sandy bank,
prepare a pyre. Vanara women comfort Tara mourning the death of
Vali with his head placed in her lap. Placing the dead body of Vali
on the pyre, Angada sets fire to it. At the end of the cremation they
all offer water to the spirit of the deceased and return to

Requested by Hanuman to visit Kiskindha, Sri Rama declines to do
so on the ground of his having been prohibited by his father to enter
the limits of a village or town and, directing that Sugriva may be
installed on the throne of Kiskindha and Angada may assume the
office of Prince Regent, he himself takes a vow to live in a cave till
the end of the monsoon and leaves instructions to initiate a

search for Sita after the MONSOON. ................................................................... 1027

Even though unable to bear the cool weather during the monsoon,
emaciated as he was due to the agony of his separation from Sita,
and chatting with Laksmana on the unbearability of his said

separation from Sita, Sri Rama describes the rainy SCASON. .......................... 1035

Recounting the virtues of Sri Rama to Sugriva, who had due to his
love of the pleasures of sense forgotten all about Sri Rama’s
business and was neglecting it even after the advent of autumn—and
reminding him of the work of Sri Rama, Hanuman urges Sugriva to
collect an army with a view to conducting a search for Sita. Awakened
to a sense of his duty, Sugriva enjoins Nila to dispatch messengers

to bring all the Vanara hordes together. ...............................................५५५५५५५५५. 1043

Glorifying Sri Rama as a hero, Laksmana comforts his brother who
was wailing in many ways at the thought of Sita, his agony of
separation from her having been accentuated by the sight of the
autumnal full moon and the water-lilies opening their petals during
the night, His heart being captured by the wealth of beauties of
autumn, Sri Rama extols the autumnal season and seeing Sugriva
inactive even during this season, sends Laksmana to whip the

Concluding from the angry words of Sri Rama that he was wroth
against Sugriva, Laksmana gets ready to kill the latter. Pacifying
Laksmana, Sri Rama, however, sends him to Sugriva with instructions
to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards him. Reaching Kiskindha with
