him of his business. Expressing his indebtedness to Sri Rama for the
unique favour done to him and giving to him an account of the efforts
made by him, Sugriva in his turn gratifies him by apprising him of

the arrival of countless monkeys from all the parts of globe. ...........

While Sri Rama and Sugriva were deliberating with each other,
Satabali and other generals of the monkey army, followed by hordes
of countless monkeys of various species, which covered the sky with
the clouds of dust raised by them, arrive in their presence

and bow down at their feet. .....................................................५.५५५५५५५५

Pointing out in pursuance of Sri Rama’s command to one of his
generals, Vinata by name, the regions in the east which could be
penetrated into by monkeys, detailing the tracts worthy of note, and
entrusting him with the task of conducting a search for Sita in those
regions, Sugriva enjoins the general to return within a month after the
work, adding that anyone returning after a month will be punished.
Specifying the different regions of the southern quarter and fixing a
limit of one month for their return, Sugriva dispatches Hanuman,
Nila, Angada and others to that quarter for finding out the

Whereabouts Of Sita. ............................................................................

Fixing a time-limit of one month, Sugriva dispatches Susena

and others to conduct a search for Sita in the western quarter. ......

Sugriva dispatches a contingent of monkeys under the leadership

of Satabali in order to seek for Sita in the northern quarter.............

With a view to inspiring confidence in Sita, when found, Sri Rama
hands over to Hanuman his signet ring as a token of recognition
while sending him away to the south. Bowing down at Sri Rama’s
feet, Hanuman leaves his presence alongwith a contingent of

the VANAra FOICES. ...........................................---५५५५ ५५५१ १५११ १५4 ११११ ५५५५५५५ ०

Bowing to the command of Sugriva and leading their respective
bands, Vinata and other monkey chiefs set forth towards the

quarter assigned to them by Sugpiva. .................................................

While Sugriva gave instructions to his various generals mentioning in
detail the places they were to visit in the course of their expedition
in search of Sita, Sri Rama was struck by the knowledge of world
geography revealed by Sugriva and inquired of the latter how he had
come to acquire such wonderful and accurate knowledge of geography.
In reply to this Sugriva tells him of the encounter of Vali with
Dundubhi, which led the former to conceive an inveterate hatred
towards him (Sugriva) who when pursued by Vali had to range from
one end of the world to another and this enabled him (Sugriva) to

gather a first-hand knowledge of all parts of the 0छ006.......................

Even after scouring more than once the regions comprised in the
quarter assigned to them, Vinata and others fail to get any clue to the
whereabouts of Sita. Returning despondent even before a month,
