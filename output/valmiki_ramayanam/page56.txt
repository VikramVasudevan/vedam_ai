While the monkeys were feeling dejected on coming out of the cave
to see the trees covered with blossom, which led them to conclude
that the latter half of winter had approached, Prince Angada reminds
them of the fierceness of Sugriva and says that a fasting till death on
their part will be preferable to an ignominious death at the latter's
cruel hands. Another monkey general, Tara, for his part suggests
that they should take shelter in Swayamprabha’s cave and thus
escape the wrath of Sugriva, who dare not enter the cave. The
monkeys fall in with the latter's view and make up their mind to

re-enter the cave and take up their abode in it. ............................................... 1129

Seeking to divert the minds of the other monkeys from the rebellious
note struck by Tara, whose advice readily found favour with Angada
and others, Hanuman warns Angada of the dire consequences which
were sure to follow in case he chose to stay away from home and,
assuring him of Sugriva’s amiability and disarming all his fears about
him, tries to convince him that they had better return to Kiskindha

and report themselves to their King. ...........................................५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५५० 1132

Sick of hearing the praises of Sugriva uttered by Hanuman and
pointing out the faults of Sugriva and denouncing him, Angada
proclaims to the monkeys his decision to undertake a fast unto death
and actually sits down to fast. Condemning Sugriva with tears in their
eyes and making the mountain caverns resound with their tale of
woe commencing from the appearance of Sri Rama on the scene
and ending with their determination to observe च fast till

death, the other monkeys too fOllOW SUit. ........................................................- 1134

Praising Providence out of joy at the prospect of deriving sustenance
for a long time on seeing a band of monkeys even as it emerged
from a cave of the Vindhyan range on hearing their noise, the vulture
king, Sampati (the elder brother of Jatayu), expresses his determination
to eat them all up one after another. Depressed to hear the vow and
declaring Jatayu, who had met his death at the hands of Ravana in
the service of Sri Rama, while trying to deliver Sita from the former’s
clutches, as more fortunate than any of them, who were threatened
with death even before accomplishing the purpose of Sri Rama,
Angada reproaches Kaikeyi, who was at the root of the whole
mischief. Distressed to hear these words of Angada and telling
Angada that he was the elder brother of Jatayu, and at the same
time inquiring about the death of his younger brother, Sampati
requests Angada to help him slide down from his high post adding

that, his wings having been burnt, he was unable to `,................................. 1137
