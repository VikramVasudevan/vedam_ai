their relative strength and flying power, he had his own wings burnt
in trying to save the wings of Jatayu by spreading his own wings
over them as a canopy, and dropped on a peak of the Vindhyan
range. Inquired by Angada if he knew anything about the abduction
of Sita, he acknowledged his having seen a youthful lady being borne
away by Ravana and crying out ‘Rama’, which now leads him to think
that she was no other than Sri Rama’s beloved spouse. Sampati
further tells Angada how, gifted as he was with an inordinately long
vision, he could see Lanka, the capital of Ravana, at a distance of
one hundred Yojanas, as well as the place where Sita has been
lodged. On his expressing a desire to offer water to the spirit of his
deceased brother, the monkeys take him to the seashore and bring
him back on his having concluded the rite. ...................................................... 1141

Interrogated by Jambavan as to how Sampati came to know about
Sita’s, abduction by Ravana, the vulture tells him that it was his son,
Suparswa, who related to him how, one day, while he was ranging
along the seashore in search of food, he had seen a young lady,
shining brightly as gold, being borne away by an ogre, of whom he
had come to know later on from the words of an eminent sage that
they were no other than Sita and Ravana, respectively. ................................. 1145
Having inspired confidence in the monkeys, Sampati proceeds to
relate to Angada and others, who longed to hear more about Sita,
the story of Sita’s abduction in greater detail. He tells them how,
having fallen on the Vindhyan range with his wings completely burnt
by the scorching sun, he swooned and regained consciousness only
on the seventh day, when he came to know that it was the Vindhyan
range on which he had fallen. Descending with difficulty from the
eminence, he made his way into the hermitage of a sage named
NiSakara, and bowed down to him. Recognizing him to be Sampati,
the sage inquired as to how his wings had come to be 0प0]ऒ.. ...................... 1148
Relating to Sage Nisakara the circumstances which led to his being
burnt, Sampati takes before the sage a vow to give up the
ghost by leaping from a mountain-peak. .........................................................- 1150
Sampati communicates to the monkeys the prediction made by Sage
Nisakara, who could foresee future events by dint of his intuitive
perception, that descending as Sri Rama elsewhere the Lord will
dispatch monkeys in quest of Sita to the Vindhyan range and that
Sampati will get back his wings as soon as he tells the monkeys
the whereabouts Of Sita. .................................................................................... 1152
Even while Sampati was thus talking with the monkeys, a pair of
beautiful wings shoot forth on his sides. Feeling transported with joy
at their sight and showing them to the monkeys, nay, assuring them
that their purpose too will likewise be achieved, Sampati soars to the
sky in order to test the power of his wings. Feeling encouraged by
this, the monkeys too resume their journey further South. .............................. 1154
