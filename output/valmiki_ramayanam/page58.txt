On the monkey heroes getting despondent at the sight of the (Indian)
ocean, which they found difficult to cross, Angada inquires of them
if anyone of them was capable of leaping across the sea dividing
India from Lanka. When all keep mum, he encourages all to proclaim

each his own leaping capacity ANd ?10%78585.. ................................................... 1155

Questioned by Angada, Gaja and other leaders of monkey hordes
proclaim each his own leaping capacity ranging in an increasing
degree from ten Yojanas or eighty miles to ninety Yojanas or seven
hundred and twenty miles. Jambavan in his turn submits that he can
leap full one hundred Yojanas or eight hundred miles but is doubtful
about his capacity to return. On Angada declaring the same thing,
Jambavan submits that for a work, which can be entrusted to a
servant alone, the services of a ruler would be out of place, and

encourages Hanuman to take up the gauntlet. ................................................ 1158

Reminding Hanuman of his descent from the loins of the wind-god
through Anjana and of the circumstances which led to his getting the
name of Hanuman and also how he received boons from Brahma
(the creator) and others, and glorifying him, Jambavan encourages
Hanuman to leap across the sea and thereby deliver the

monkeys from their wretched plight. ................................................................. 1161

Proclaiming his own glory in order to dispel the fears of the monkeys
after assuming enormous proportions with a view to leaping across
the sea, and climbing up Mount Mahendra, Hanuman prepares to
