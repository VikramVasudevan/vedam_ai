* AYODHYAKANDA +

Bharata began to exude sweat, born of
the fire of grief, from all his limbs in the
same way as the Himalaya mountain heated
by the sun’s rays allows its snow to melt
and flow. (18)
ध्याननिर्दरशैलेन विनि:श्चसितधातुना |
दैन्यपादपसंघेन शोकायासाधिशृङ्गिणा tt १९॥
प्रमोहानन्तसत्त्वेन संतापौषधिवेणुना |
आक्रान्तो दु:खशैलेन महता कैकयीसुत:॥ २०॥

Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, was weighed
down by a huge mountain of agony, consisting
of a compact mass of rocks in the shape of
loving contemplation on Sri Rama, which
contained minerals in the shape of sighs, was
clothed with a cluster of trees in the shape of
recoiling of the senses from their objects and
was crowned with a tall peak in the shape of
languor caused by grief, infested by
numberless beasts in the shape of swoons
and covered by herbs and bamboos in the
shape of burning of the internal and external
organs of sense. (19-20)

विनि:श्चसन् वै भृशदुर्मनास्तत:

Wyeda: परमापदं गत:।
wa न लेभे हृदयज्वरार्दितो

नरर्षभो यूथहतो यथर्षभ:॥ २१॥

Like a bull strayed from its herd,
Bharata, a jewel among men—who, having
really fallen in extreme adversity, felt
miserably disconsolate, his mind being
utterly confused in consequence, and was
heaving sighs, afflicted as he was with
anguish of heart—found no peace in his
bed. (21)
Tet सार्धं भरत: समागतो

महानुभाव: सजन: समाहित:।
सुदुर्मनास्तं भरतं det पुन-
te: समाश्वासयदग्रजं प्रति॥ २२॥

When the noble-minded Bharata, who,
though composed, felt very disconsolate,
got united alongwith his men with Guha

again, the latter reassured him once more
with reference to his elder brother. (22)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्येऽयोध्याकाण्डे
पञ्चाशीतितम: सर्ग: ॥ ८५ Il

Thus ends Canto Eighty-five in the Ayodhyakanda of the glorious Ramayana
of Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.

षडशीतितम: सर्ग:
Canto LXXXVI

Guha reports to Bharata how Sri Rama and his party broke their journey at
Srngaverapura and reproduces before him the dialogue that took place
between Laksmana and himself at night and further tells him
how the two brothers entangled their locks into a thick
mass, crossed the holy river with Sita and left for
the hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja

आचचक्षेऽथ सद्भावं लक्ष्मणस्य महात्मन:।
भरतायाप्रमेयाय गुहो TEMA: १॥
Guha, who used to roam about in the
woods, now reported to Bharata, who was
immeasurably great, the praiseworthy attitude

of the high-souled Laksmana towards his

eldest brother : (1)
तं जाग्रतं गुणैर्युक्तं वरचापेषुधारिणम्।
भ्रातृगुप्त्यर्थमत्यन्तमहं लक्ष्मणमब्रुवम्॥ २॥
