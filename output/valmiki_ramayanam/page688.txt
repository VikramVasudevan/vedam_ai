matter for reproach, since a proxy is allowed
only in case the man replaced by him is
unable to discharge the obligation imposed
on him. The demand of Kaikeyi was but

Indeed, all will be well with this high-souled
prince, who is true to his promise. (30)

अनेन धर्मशीलेन वनात् प्रत्यागत: पुन:।
भ्रात्रा सह भविष्यामि पृथिव्या: पतिरुत्तम:॥ ३१॥

earth with this pious brother of mine. (31)

अनृतान्मोचयानेन पितरं तं महीपतिम्॥ ३२॥

“As the king was solicited for a boon
by Kaikeyi, his pledge given to her has
been implemented by me by being in exile
in the forest. Now, acquit the said king, our
father, of the charge of falsehood by ruling
over Ayodhya and thereby discharging your
part of the obligation.” (32)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्येऽयोध्याकाण्डे

Thus ends Canto One hundred and eleven in the Ayodhyakanda of the glorious
Ramayana of Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.
