give me fourfold more fame and happiness
than that from having obtained the kingdom.”
(21)

एवं तु विलपन् दीनो भरत: स महायशा:।
नन्दिग्रामेऽकरोद् राज्यं दु:खितो मन्त्रिभि: Geil २२॥
Lamenting this way the dispirited Bharata
of great fame, even though sad, looked
after the state administration alongwith the
council of ministers from Nandigrama. (22)
स वल्कलजटाधारी मुनिवेषधर: wy: |
नन्दिग्रामेऽवसद् efit: ससैन्यो भरतस्तदा॥ २३॥
Wearing the bark of trees on his person
and matted locks on his head and thus
assuming the garb of an ascetic, the said
powerful and wise Bharata then lived at
Nandigrama with the army; (23)

पादुके त्वभिषिच्याथ नन्दिग्रामेऽवसत् तदा॥ २४॥

Bharata, obedient to his elder brother,
fulfiller of his vows, lover of his brothers,
wishing always the return of Sri Rama, lived
in Nandigrama after coronating the wooden-
sandals on the throne. (24)

* VALMIKI-RAMAYANA «

सवालव्यजनं ot धारयामास स स्वयम्।
Wd: शासनं सर्वं पादुकाभ्यां निवेदयन्॥ २५॥
Committing the whole administration to
the care of the wooden sandals, the
celebrated Bharata himself held the royal
umbrella alongwith the Chowrie over them
as a mark of respect. (25)

ततस्तु भरत: श्रीमानभिषिच्यार्यपादुके।
तदधीनस्तदा Ut कारयामास सर्वदा॥ २६॥

Having then consecrated the wooden
sandals of his elder brother on the throne of
Ayodhya, the glorious Bharata for his part
now carried on the rule, being always
subordinate to them. (26)

तदा fe यत् कार्यमुषैति किंचि-

स पादुकाभ्यां प्रथमं निवेद्य
चकार पश्चाद् Wal यथावत्॥ २७॥
Submitting in the first instance to the
wooden sandals whatever affair of the State
came up before him, nay, whatever highly
valuable present was offered to the State,
the said Bharata dealt with it in the proper
way afterwards. (27)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्येऽयोध्याकाण्डे

Thus ends Canto One hundred and fifteen in the Ayodhyakanda of the glorious
Ramayana of Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.
