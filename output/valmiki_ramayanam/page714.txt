“This is the path followed by eminent
Rsis gathering fruits in the forest. It would be
advisable for you to make to the forest, which
is difficult of access, by this path alone.” (21)

* VALMIKI-RAMAYANA «

Spoken to as above by the ascetics
with folded hands as च gesture of
supplication, Sri Rama, a scion of Raghu,
the scorcher of his foes, when he had been
presented by the Brahmanas with flowers
etc., accompanied by good wishes and
benedictions, made his way into the heart of
the forest alongwith his consort and
Laksmana, as the sun would penetrate a
mass of clouds. (22)

इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्येऽयोध्याकाण्डे
एकोनविंशत्यधिकशततम: AA: ॥ ११९ ॥

Thus ends Canto One hundred and nineteen in the Ayodhyakanda of the glorious
Ramayana of Valmiki, the work of a Rsi and the oldest epic.

॥ अयोध्याकाण्डं सम्पूर्णम्॥
