Canto |

When Sri Rama approached the Pampa lake, the sight of the lovely
surroundings intensified his pangs of separation from Sita. Put in
mind of Sita, he laments for her. Living with his ministers
on the summit of the Rsyamuka hill, Sugriva catches
sight of the two princes and gets alarmed

स तां पुष्करिणीं गत्वा पद्मोत्पलझषाकुलाम्।
राम: सौमित्रिसहितो विललापाकुलेन्द्रिय:।॥ १॥
Reaching alongwith Laksmana (son of
Sumitra) the aforesaid pond abounding in
lotuses, lilies and fishes, Sri Rama, whose
mind was troubled, burst into a wail. (1)

wa qeda at हर्षादिन्द्रयाणि चकम्पिरे।
a कामवशमापन्न: सौमित्रिमिदमब्रवीत्॥ २॥

Immediately on seeing the pond there
the senses of Sri Rama felt excited through
delight. Fallen a prey to love, he spoke as
follows to Laksmana (son of Sumitra) : (2)

सौमित्रे शोभते पम्पा वैदूर्यविमलोदका।
फुल्लपद्मोत्पलवती शोभिता विविधैर्द्रमै:।। ३॥

“Containing full-blown lotuses and lilies
and adorned with trees of every description,
and with its water transparent as a cat’s-
eye gem, O Laksmana (son of Sumitra),
Pampa looks charming. (3)

सौमित्रे पश्य पम्पाया: काननं शुभदर्शनम्।
aa राजन्ति शैला वा द्रुमा: सशिखरा इव॥४॥
“Behold, O Laksmana (son of Sumitra),
the woodland surrounding Pampa, so
pleasant to the sight, the trees looking
as though crested with their towering
boughs, spread their charm like mountains.
(4)

मां तु शोकाभिसंतप्तमाधय: utara वै।
भरतस्य च दु:खेन वैदेह्या RIA Ail

“Agonies of various kinds for their part
undoubtedly afflict me, sore-stricken as |
already am with grief caused by Bharata’s
sad plight and the abduction of Sita, a
princess of the Videha territory. (5)

शोकार्तस्यापि A पम्पा शोभते चित्रकानना।
व्यवकीर्णा बहुविधै: पुष्पै: शीतोदका शिवा॥ ६॥

“The delightful Pampa, which is lined
by a picturesque woodland and interspersed
