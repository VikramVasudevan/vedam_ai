BOOK I, CHAP. 19 । 119

पराशर उवाच
इत्युक्तास्तेन ते wa संस्पृष्टाश्च निरामया:।
समुत्तस्थुद्दिजा भूयस्तञ्चोचु: प्रश्रयान्वितम्॥४१॥

Thus having prayed, the Brahmanas
immediately rose up, uninjured and rejoicing;
and bowing respectfully to Prahlada, they
blessed him, and said,

पुरोहिता ऊचु:
दीर्घायुरप्रतिहत-बलवीर्यसमन्वित:।
पुत्र-पौत्र-धनैश्वर्ययुक्तो वत्स। भवोत्तम।। 2

Excellent prince, may your days be many;
irresistible be your prowess; and power and
wealth and posterity be thine.
पराशर sara

इत्युक्त्वा तं ततो गत्वा यथावृत्तं पुरोहिता:।
दैत्यराजाय सकलमाचचक्षुर्महामुने॥४३॥
इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे प्रथमांशेऽष्टादशोऽध्याय:।

Having thus spoken, they withdrew, and
went and told the king of the Daityas all that
had passed.

NOTES

]. This is not the doctrine of the impassibility of
soul, taught in the Vedas : हन्ता चेन्मन्यते हन्तुं हतश्चेन्मन्यते
wai उभौ तौ न विजानीमो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते 'We do not
recognise either the doctrin. that supposes the
slayer to slay or the slain to be killed; this (spiritual
existence) neither kills nor is killed.’ The same is
inculcated at great length, and with great beauty. in
the Bhagavat Gita ; 44 छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावक:।
ने चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुत:॥ ‘Weapons wound it
not; fire doth not consume it; water cannot drown
it: nor doth it wither before the winds:' or, as
rendered by Schlegel, ‘Non illum penetant tela; non
illum comburit flamma; neque illum perfundunt
aquae; nec ventus exsiccat,' P.17. new edition. But
in the passage of our text. all that the Hindus
understand of Fate. is referred to. Death or
immunity, prosperity or adversity, are in this life
the inevitable consequences of conduct in a prior
existence : no man can suffer a penalty which his
vices in a preceding state of being have not
incurred, nor can he avoid it if they have.
