THE VISNU-PURANAM

‘Fearless:’ not dreading agitation or perplexity by
ideas of तपशा।४ (ट्वैतस्फुत्तेरभयं) ‘Pure;' undisturbed by
external objects (fava). ‘Not the theme of
reasoning: (दुर्विभाव्यं); that is. ‘not to be ascertained
by logical deduction’ (aaa ). 'Stands in no need
of support’ (असंश्रितं), not resting or depending upon
perceptible objects (निर्विषयत्वादाश्रयशून्यं).

7. The great Yoga is produced (महायोगो ara).
This great Yoga, or union, is to have its relation or
dependence (सालम्बन:), which is Visnu (वैष्णव:; and
its seed (सवीज:), or mystical ejaculations; and to be
accompanied with Mantras and silent repetitions, or
Japa (मन्त्रजपादि सहित).

8. Or of pearl, ruby, emerald, sapphire, and
diamond.

9. We have in the text 2 representation of one
mode of Dhyana, or contemplation, in which the

conception of a thing is attempted to be rendered
more definite by thinking upon its types : or in
which, at least. the thoughts are more readily
concentrated by being addressed to a sensible
emblem, instead of an abstract truth. Thus the Yogi
here says to himself.:"I meditate upon the jewel on
Visnu's brow, as the soul of the world : upon the
gem on his breast, as the first principle of things;"
and so on : and thus through a perceptible
substance proceeds to an imperceptible idea.

10. Akhyandni (आख्यानानि) is said to denote the
Puranas, and Anuvada (अनुवाद:) the Kalpa, Sutra,
and similar works, containing directions for
supplementary rites.

11. The celebrated lake Pokher in Ajmer.
