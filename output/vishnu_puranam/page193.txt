evidently connected with the Lok&loka of the
Hindus. According to the Siva Tantra, the El
Dorado, at the foot of the Lokaloka mountains, is
the play-ground of the gods (हेममयी भूमिर्देवानां
क्रोडनार्थाय)।

7. This comprises the planetary spheres : for the
diameter of the seven zones and oceans— each
ocean being of the same diameter as the continent it
encloses, and each successive continent being twice
the diameter of that which precedes it- amounts to
but two crores and fifty-four lacs. The golden land
is twice the diameter of Puskara, or two crores and
fifty-six lacs; and the Lokdloka is but ten thousand
Yojanas. So that the whole is five crores ten lacs
and ten thousand (5.10.10.000). According to the
Siva Tantra, the golden land is ten crores of
Yojanas, making, with the seven continents, one
fourth of the whole measurement. Other
calculations occur, the incompatibility of which is
said by the commentators on our text, and on that
of the Bhagavata, to arise from reference being
made to different Kalpas, and they quote the same
stanza to this effect ; क्वचित् क्वचित्पुराणेषु विरोधो यदि
meas कल्पभेदादिभिस्तत्र व्यवस्था सद्भिरिष्यते। "Whenever any
contradictions in different Puranas are observed,
they are ascribed by the pious to differences of
Kalpas and the like.
