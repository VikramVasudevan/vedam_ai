THE VISNU-PURANAM

weights and measures (A. R. 5. 105); the Sarnkhya
Parimana, cities the Varaha Purana for a peculiar
computation. and quotes another from the Bhavis
ya, different from that which occurs in the first
chapter of that work, to which we have referred.
The principle of the calculation adopted by the
astronomical works is different: it is, 6 respirations
(Prana)=l Vikala; 60 Vikalés==l Danda; 60
Dandas=I sydereal day. The Nimesa. which is the
base of one of the Pauranik modes, is a twinkle of
the eye of a man at rest; whilst the Param4nu which
is the origin of the other, and apparently more
modern system, considcring the works in which it
occurs, is the time taken by a Paramanu. or mote in
the sun-beam, to pass through a crevice in a shutter.
Some indications of this calculation being in
common currency, occur in the Hindustani terms
Renu (Trasarenu) and Lamhu (Laghu) in Indian
horometry (A.R.5.81); whilst the more ordinary.
system seems derived from the astronomical works,
being 60 Tilas=l Vipala; 60 Vipalas=1 Pala; 60
Palas=] Danda or Ghari. Ibid.

4. These calculations of time are found in most
of the Puranas, with some addition, occasionally, of
no importance, as that of the year of the seven Rsis,
3030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9090
such years, in the Linga Purana in all essential
points the computations accord, and the scheme,
extravagant as it may appear, seems to admit of
easy explanation. We have, in the first place, a
computation of the years of the gods in the four

ages, OF,

If these divine years are converted into years of
mortals, by multiplying them by 360. a year of men
being a day of the gods, we obtain the years of
which the Yugas of mortals are respectively said to
consist:

4800x360 = 1,728,000
3600x360 = 1.296,000
2400x360 = 864,000
1200x360 432,000
4,320,000 a Mahayuga.

So that these periods resolve themselves into
very simple elements: the notion of four ages in a
deteriorating series expressed by descending
arithmetical progression, as 4, 3, 2,1; the
conversion of units into thousands; and the
mythological fiction, that these were divine years,
each composed of 360 years of men. It does not
secm necessary to refer the invention to any
astronomical computations, or to any attempt to
represent actual chronology.

5. The details of these, as occurring in each
Manvantara, are given in the third book. c. | and 2.

6. चतुर्युगानां संख्याता साधिका ह्येकसप्तति:। One and
seventy enumerations of the four ages, with a
surplus.’ A similar reading occurs in several other
Puranas, but none of them state of what the surplus
or addition consists; but it is, infact, the number of
years required to reconcile two computations of the
Kalpa. The most simple, and probably the original
calculation of a Kalpa. is its being 1000 great ages,
or ages of the gods: एतद्द्वा दशसाहस्रं देवानां युगमुच्यते।
रात्रिरुच्यते।। Bhavisya Purana Then 4,320,000 years,
or a divine age, x 1000=4,320,000,000 years, or a
day or night of Brahma. But a day of Brahma is
also seventy-one times a great age multiplied by
fcurteen: 4,320,000x7 1 x14=4,294,080,000; or less
than the preceding by 25,920,000; and it is to make
up for this deficiency that a certain number of years
must be added to the computation by Manvantaras.
According to the Siirya Siddhanta, as cited by
Davis (A. R. 2. 231), this addition consists of a
