BOOK II, CHAP. 7

or parrot, that, in the act of teaching it to cry Rama
or Krsna or Radha, they may themselves repeat
these appelatons; the simple recitation of which,
even if accidentally, irreverently, or reluctantly
performed, is meritorious. Thus according to the
Mavt Dharma Tantra + चक्रायुधस्य नामानि सदा सर्व्वत्र

wea पवित्रकरो यत।। हरिर्हरति पापानि
टुष्टघित्तैरपिस्मृत | अनिच्छयापि संस्पृष्टो दहत्यपि fe पावक:॥ ‘Let
व man ever and every where repeat the names of the
discus-armed (Visnu); for its repetition, even by
one who is impure, is a means of purification. Hari
removes all sins, even when invoked by evil-
minded persons, as fire burns one by whom it is
unwillingly approached.'

commentator is to show that the common notions
of heaven and hell are erroneous; that they are only
temporal pleasure and temporal pain; and virtue
and vice, being the origion of transient, and
therefore unreal effects, are themselves unrealities:
there is nothing real but faith in Visnu.

15 Text and comment are here somewhat
obscure; but the purport of the former seems to be
the explanation of the existence of Jnin, wisdom,
both as a genus and a species : in the former case it
is all that is; and in the latter, it may be either true
or false wisdom : the latter being influenced by
notions of self or individuality, and therefore the
cause of confinement to existence; the former
dissipating the belief of self, and being therefore
the cause of liberation from bodily being :
मोक्षायेष्यते।
