Sandhi to each Manvantara, equal to the Satya age,
or 1,728,000 years; and one similar Sandhi at the
commencement of the Kalpa: .

thus — 4,320,000x71=306,720,000+ 1,728,000=
308,448,000 x 14=4318,272,000+1,728,000
4320,000,000. The Pauraniks, however, omit the
Sandhi of the Kalpa, and add the whole
compensation to the Manvantaras. The amount of
this in whole numbers is 1,851,428 in each
Manvantara. or
4,320,000x7 1=306,720,000-+ 1.85 1,428==
308,571,428 x 14 = 4319,999,992: leaving a very
small inferiority to the result of the calculation of a
Kalpa by a thousand great ages. To provide for this
deficiency, indeed, very minute sub-divisions are
admitted into the calculation; and the commentator
on our text says, that the additional years, if of
gods, are 5142 years. 10 months, 8 days, 4 watches,
2 Muhirttas, 8 Kalas, 17 Kasthas, 2 Nimesas, and
1/7th; if of mortals, 1,851,428 years, 6 months, 24
days. 12 Naris. 12 Kalas, 25 Kasthds, and [0 Nimes
as. It will be observed, that in the Kalpa we have
the regular descending series 4, 3. 2, with cyphers
multiplied ad libitum.

7. The Brahm4 Vaivartta says 108 years, but this
is unusual. Brahma's life is but a Nimesa of Krsna,
according to that work; a Nimesa of Siva.
according to the Saiva Purana.

8. In the last book the Pararddha occurs as a very
different measure of time, but it is employed here
in its ordinary acceptation.

9. In theory the Kalpas are infinite; as the Bhavis
ya: सहस्राणि कल्पानां मुनिसत्तमा:। गतानि तावच्छेषाणि॥
‘Excellent sages, thousands of millions of Kalpas
have passed, and as many are to come.’ In the Linga
Purana, and others of the Saiva division, above
thirty Kalpas are named, and some account given of
several but they are evidently  sectarial
embellishments. The only Kalpas usually specified
are those which follow in the text : the one which
was the last, or the Padma. and the present or
Variha. The first is also commonly called the
Brahma; but the Bhagavata distinguishes the
Brahma, considering it to be the first of Brahmda's
life. whilst the Padma was the last of the first
Pararddha. The term Maha, or great Kalpa applied
to the Padma is attached to it only in a general
sense; or. according to the commentator. because it
comprises, as a minor Kalpa, that in which Brahma
was born from a lotus. Properly, a great Kalpa is
not a day, but a life of Brahma; as in the Brahma

Vaivarita: ब्ह्मणश्चायुषा कल्प: कालविद्भिर्निरूपित:। क्षुद्रकल्पा

सम्बर्त्तदय: स्मृता:॥ Chronologers compute a
Kalpa by the life of Brahma. Minor Kalpas, as
Samvartta and the rest, are numerous.’ Minor
Kalpas here denote every period of destruction, or
those in which the Samvartta wind, or other
destructive agents, operate. Several other
computations of tune are found in different
Puranas, but it will be sufficient to notice one
which occurs in the Hari Varhsa. as it is peculiar,
and because it is not quite correctly given in M.
Langlois’ translation It is the calculation of the
Manava time. or time of a Manu.

10. divine years =a day and night of a Manu.
10 Manava days = his fortnight.
10 Manava form. = his month.
12 Manava months = his season.
6 Manava seasons = his year.

Accordingly the commentator says 72000 divine
years make up his year. The French translation has,
“dix annees des dieux font un jour de Manu; dix
jours des dieux font un pakcha de Manu," etc, The
error lies in the expression "jours des dieux” and is
evidently a mere inadvertence : for if ten years
make a day, ten days can scarcely make a fortnight.
