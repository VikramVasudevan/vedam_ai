200 THE VISNU-PURANAM

हिमोष्ण-वारिवृष्टीनां हेतुत्वे समयं a २१॥
इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे द्वितीयांशे दशमोऽथ्याय:।

In this manner, Maitreya, a troop of sexen
celestial beings, supported by the energy of
Visnu, occupies during the several months the
orb of the sun. The sages celebrates his praise,
and the Gandharba sings, and the nymph
dances before him : the Rakgasa attends upon
his steps, the serpent harnesses his steeds, and
the Yaksa trims the reins : the numerous
pigmy sages, the Balakhilyas, ever surround
his chariot. The whole troop of seven, attached
to the sun’s car, are the agents in the
distribution of cold, heat, and rain, at their
respective seasons.

NOTES

1. It might be doubted whether the text meant
180 in each hemisphere or in both, but the sense is
sufficiently clear in the Vayu, &c., and the number
of Mandalas, travelled in the year is 360 : the
Mandalas, ‘circles’ or ‘degrees’, being in fact the
sun’s diurnal revolutions, and their numbers
corresponding with the days of the solar year : as in
the Bhavisya Purana ; ह्यशीतिमण्डलशतमोहन्त्यब्देन चै
हया:। बाह्यतोऽभ्यन्तरं चैव मण्डलं दिवसक्रमात्। ‘The horses
of the sun travel twice 180 degrees in a eyar,
internal and external (to the equator), in the order
of the days.’

2. A similar enumeration of the attendants upon
the sun’s car occurs in the Vayu, &c. For Yaksas,
the generic term their employed is Gra,anis, but the
individuals are the same. The Karma and Bhavisya
refer the twelve Adityasa to different months :

Visnu. Kirma. _ Bhavisya.

Aryamat Vaisakha Caitra Vaisakha
