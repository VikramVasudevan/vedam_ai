BOOK Ill, CHAP. 4 235

pronuntiando, numen adorans, mei memor;' where
‘numen adorans’, although it may be defended as
necessary to the sense, is not expressed by the
words of the text, nor compatible with Hindu
notions. In one of the MSS. employed, the
transcriber has evidently been afraid of desecrating
this sacred monosyllable and has therefore altered
the text, writing it भ्रुवमेकाक्षरं ब्रह्म द्वापराहे व्यवस्थितं

instead of ध्रुवमेकाक्षरं ओमित्येवं व्यवस्थितं।

5. The daily prayers of the Brahmana commence
with the formula. Or bhith, bhuvah, svar : Om
earth, sky, heaven : these are the three mystical
terms called Vyahrtis and are scarcely of less
sanctity that the Pranava itself. Their efficacy and
the order of their repetition preceding the Gayatri,
are fully detailed in Manu, II. 76-81. In the Mitaks
ara they are directed to be twice repeated minutely,
with Oth prefixed to each; Orh bhih, Or bhuvah,
Orn svar; the breath being suppressed by closing
the lips and nostrils ; ओं भू: ओं ya: ओम् स्वरितित्रीन् वारान्

। वायुन्नरुन्धन् मनसा जपेत्।

6. The form or sensible type of Vasudeva is here
considered to be the monosyllable Or and which is
one with the thrce mystical, words, Bhth, Bhuvah,
Svar and with the Vedas : consequently the
Vyahrtis and the Vedas are also forms of Vasudeva,
diversified as to their typical character, but
essentially one and the same.
