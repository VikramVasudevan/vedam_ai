understood, when it afforded a _ favourable
opportunity for a fable. It may be suspected in the
present instance that the legend is posterior, not
only to the Veda, but to the grammatical rule or it
would have furnished Panini with a different
etymology.

4. This is another specimen of the sort of
Paronomasia explained in the preceding note. The
Carakas are the students of a Sakha, so
denominated from its teacher Caraka. (As. Res.
VUI. 377). So, again, Panini, 4.3.107 : 'The readers
of that which is said by Caraka are Carakas:' चरकेन
प्रोक्तं चरका:। Caraka has no necessary connection with
Cara, 'to go'. The Vayu states they were also called
Catakas, from Cata (42), 'to divide’, because they
shared amongst them their master's guilt. 'Those
pupils of VaiSampayana weie called Catakas by
whom the crime of Brahmanicide was shared; and
Carakas from its departure;) वैशम्पायनशिष्यास्ते चरका
समुदाहृता: ब्रह्महत्यातुयैश्चीर्णा चरणाच्च चरका स्मृता:।

5. The Vayu names the fifteen teachers of these
schools, Kanva, Vaidheya, Salin, Madhyandina,
Sapeyin, Vidagdha, Uddalin, Tamrayani, Vatsya,
Galava, Saigiri, Atavya, Parna, Virana and
Samparayana, who were the founders of no fewer
than 101 branches of the Vajasaneyi or white Yajus
. Colebrooke specifies several of these, as the
Jabalas, Baudhayanas, Tapaniyas. As. Res. VIII.
376.
