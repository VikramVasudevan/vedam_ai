BOOK HI, CHAP. 12 267

meat which is dressed in the first instance for an
individual being prohibited; as by YAjfiavalkya :
बृथामांसं वर्ज्जयेत्। Let him avoid flesh killed in vain;'
or that which is not the residue of an offering to the
gods, tarreatafire यन्नभवति। So also Manu, V.7.

17. By dried vegetables, etc. (शूष्कशाकादिकं) is to
be understood unboiled vegetables or potherbs
dressed without being sprinkled with water :
जलोपसेकं विना te! Instead of बदरिकेभ्य: ‘jujubes', the
reading is sometimes हरितकेभ्य: 'myrobalans' : the
other term, गुडपक्वेभ्य:, is explained 'sweet-meats'.
The construction here, however, is somewhat
obscure.

18. As oil-cake or the sediment of any thing after
expression.

19. So Manu, II. 101 and IV. 93.

20. So Manu, IV. 128.
