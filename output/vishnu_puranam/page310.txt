THE VISNU-PURANAM

melting with benevolence; final felicity is in
his grasp.
ये कामक्रोधलोभानां वीतरागा न गोचरे।

सदाचारस्थितास्तेषामनुभावैर्धृता मही॥४२॥

The earth is upheld by the veracity of those
who have subdued their passions and
following righteous practices, are never
contaminated by desire, covetousness and
wrath.

तस्मात्सत्यं वदेत् प्राज्ञो यत् परप्रीतिकारणम्।
सत्यं यत् परदु:खाय तत्र मौनपरो भवेत्।४३॥
प्रियं युक्तं fat नैतदिति मत्वा न तद्वदेत्।
श्रेयस्तत्र fed वाक्यं यद्यप्यत्यन्तमप्रियम्॥४४॥
प्राणिनामुपकाराय यथैवेह परत्र च।

कर्मणा मनसा वाचा तदेव मतिमान् भजेत्॥४५॥
इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे तृतीयांऽशे द्वादशोध्याय:॥ ११॥

Let therefore a wise man ever speak the
truth when it is agreeable and when the truth
would inflict pain let him hold his peace. Let
him not utter that which, though acceptable,
would be detrimental; for it were better to
speak that which would be salutary, although
it should give exceeding offence.® A
considerate man will always cultivate, in act,
thought and speech, that which is good for
living beings, both in this world and in the
next."”

NOTES

1, Manu, IV. 71. "He who breaks clay or cute
grass or bites his nails, will speedily fall to ruin."

2. Manu, IV. 130.

3. Ibid. 57.

4. Ibid. 78

5. Ibid. 45

6. Ibid. 52

7. Manu, IV. 101. The legislator is much more
copious on this subject than the author of the
Purana.

8. So Manu, IV. 138. "Let him say what is true,
but let him say what is pleasing. Let him speak no
disagreeable truth, nor let him speak agreeable
falsehood. This is a primeval rule."

9. That the preceding chapter agrees in many
respects very closely with the contents of the fourth

book of the Institutes of Manu, on economics and
private morals, will be evident from the instances
cited of some of the parallel passages. Several
others might have been adduced.
