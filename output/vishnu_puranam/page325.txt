284 THE VISNU-PURANAM

of Kullaka Bhatta of this’ and the verse preceding;
व्रतस्थमपि दौहित्रं श्राद्धे यत्ने न भोजयेत्। कुतपं चासने दद्यात्। ‘Let
him give his daughter's son, though a religious
student, food at a Sraddha and the blanket for a
seat.' The commentator on our text says that some
understand by Dauhitra, clarified butter. made from
the milk of a cow fed with grass gathered on the
day of new moon; and some explain it a plate or
dish of buffalo horn. Kutapa he interprets by Ast
ama Muhirta, the eighth hour of the day or a little
afternoon, although he admits that some render it a
blanket made of goats' wool. These explanations
are also noticed in the Nirnaya Sindhu, p. 302; and
upon the authority of the Matsya Purana, Kutapa is
said to mean eight things, which equally consume
(Tapa) all sin (Ku) or noon, a vessel of rhinoceros'
horn, a Nepal blanket, silver, holy grass, sesamum,
kine and a daughter's son : मध्याह्न: स्वद्रपात्रं च तथा
नेपालकम्बल:। Ue दर्भास्तिला गावो दौहित्रश्चाष्टम: स्मृत:। पापं
कुत्सितमित्याहुस्तस्य सन्तापकारिण:। अष्टावेते यतस्तस्मात् कुतपा इति
विश्रुता :।

16. So the Matsya Purana has 'the gift, sight and
name of silver are desired:' रजतस्य तथा दानं दर्शनं नाम
चेष्यते। The notion originates with Manu, III. 202.

17. The same doctrine is inculcated by the Vayu
Purana; but it appears to be a Pauranik innovation,
for Manu places the Brahmana intent on scriptural
knowledge and on austere devotion on a level and
makes no mention of the Yogi, IIT. 134.
