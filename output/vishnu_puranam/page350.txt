३06 THE VISNU-PURANAM

26. Dhumraksa and Samyama ; Bhagavata.

27. The text is clear enough; q#ward सहदेवस्तत:
HMA: | but, as elsewhere noticed (Hindu Theatre, Ii.
296), the commentator on the Bhagavata interprets
the parallel passage, संयमादासीत् कृशाश्व: सहदेवज:। very
differently or सहदेवज: Rasa सहित:। 'Krisasva with
Devaja' or as some copies read, Devaka or Daivata,
as if there were two sons of Samyama.

28. The Bhagavata changes the order of these
two, making Janamejaya the son of Sumati; or
Pramati, Vayu, Sumati, king of Vaisalf, is made
contemporary with Rama : Ramayana, I. 47. 17.
The dynasty of Vaisala kings is found only in our
text, the Vayu and Bhagavata. Hamilton places
them from 1920 to 1940 B.C.; but the latter is
incompatible with the date he assigns to Rama, of
1700 B.C. The contemporary existence of Sumati
and Rama, however, is rather unintelligible, as,
according to our lists, the former is the thirty-fourth
and the latter the sixtieth, from Vaivasvata Manu.

29. The circumstances of their marriage, of
Cyavana's appropriating a share of offerings to the
ASvinikumaras and of his quarrel with Indra in
consequence, are told in detail in the Bhagavata and
Padma Puranas.

30. In most of the other Puranas, Reva or Raiva.
The Linga and Matsya insert a Rocamana before
him; and the Bhagavata adds to Anartta,
Uttanavarhis and Bhtrisena.

31. The Bhagavata ascribes the foundation of
KuSasthali to Revata, who built it, it is said, within
the sea : अन्त: समुद्रे। The subsequent legend shows
that it was the same or on the some spot, as
Dvaraka; and Anartta was therefore part of Kutch
or Gujarat. See Bk. I. Ch. प्रा. n. 77.

32. So called from its many Dvaras or gateways :
पुरीं द्वारवती are बहुद्वारां मनोरमां —Vayu.

33. The object of this legend, which is told by
most of the authorities, is obviously to account for
the anachronism of making Balarama contemporary
with Raivata; the one early in the Treté age and the
other at the close of the Dvapara.
