BOOK IV, 5

understanding the meaning of the term, has coveted
KauSalya into the son of Hiranyanabha. Raghu
Vamsa 18.27. The Bhagavata, like out text, calls
the prince the pupil of Jaimini. The Vayu, more
correctly, जैमिने: पौत्रस्य: शिष्य:। ‘the pupil of the sage's
grandson.’ There seems to be, however, something
unusual in the account given of the relation borne
by the individuals named to each other. As a pupil
of Jaimini, Hiranyanaébha is the teacher of the
Samaveda (Bk. II. Ch. VJ), but Yajfiavalkya is the
teacher of the Vajasaneyi branch of the Yajvs (Bk.
WI. Ch. V). Neither of them is specified by
Colebrooke amongst the authorities of the Patafijala
or Yoga philosophy; nor does either appear as a
disciple of Jaimini in his character of founder of the
Mimamsa school. Trans. R. As. Soc. Vol.1.

27. Arthasiddhi : Brahma Purana and Hari
Varhsa.

28. Maruta : Brahma Purana and Hari VarhSa.
These authorities omit the succeeding four names.

29. Sahasavat : Vayu.

30. Visvasaha : Bhagavata.

31. The list closes here, as the author of the
Puranas, Vyasa, is contemporary with the great
war. The line of Iksvaku is resumed prophetically
in the twenty-second chapter.
