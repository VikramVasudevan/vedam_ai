३३4 THE VISNU-PURANAM

16. Vasvananta.

17. Yuyudhana, Subhasana, Sruta.

18. Sunaka.

19, आत्मविद्याश्रयिणो भविष्यन्ति is the reading of all the
copies; but why the future verb, ‘will be’, is used
does not appear.

20. Descendants of two of the other sons of the
Manu are noticed in the Bhagavata; from Nrga, it is
said, proceeded Sumati, Bhitajyotis, Vasu, Pratifka,
Oghavat and his sister Oghavati, married to
SudarSana. The Linga gives three sons to Nrga, Vrs
a, Dhrstaka and Ranadhrsta and alludes to a legend
of his having been changed to a lizard by the curse
of a Brahmana. Narisyanta's descendants were
Citrasena, Daksa, Madhvat, Pirva, Indrasena,
Vitihotra, Satyasrava, Urusravas, Devadatta,
Agnivesya, also called Jatukarna, a form of Agni
and progenitor of the Agnivesya Brahmanas. In the
Brahma Purana and Hari Varnsa Purana the sons of
Narisyat, whom the commentator on the latter
considers as the same with Narisyanta, are termed
Sakas, Sacae or Scythians; while, again, it is said
that the son of Narisyanta was Dama or as
differently read, Yama. As this latter affiliation is
stated in the authorities, it would appear as if this
Narisyanta was one of the sons of the Manu; but
this is only a proof of the carelessness of the
compilation, for in the Visnu, Vayu and
Markandeya Puranas, Narisyanta, the father of
Dama, is the son of Marutta, the fourteenth of the
posterity of Dista or Nedista.
