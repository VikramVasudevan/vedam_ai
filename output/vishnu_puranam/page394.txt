BOOK IV, 8 345

existed, partaking more of the character of schools
of doctrine, but in which teachers and scholars were

intermarrying; and the whole, as well as their
original founder, imply the interference of the Ks
atriya caste with the Brahmanical monopoly of
religious instruction and composition.
