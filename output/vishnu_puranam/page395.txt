Ayus, the eldest son of Purtiravas, married
the daughter of Rahu (or Arahu), by whom he
had five sons, Nahusa, Ksatravrddha,'
Rambha,” Raji and Anenas.? The son of Ks
atravrddha was Suhotra,’ who had three sons,
Kasa,’ Lesga° and Ghrtasamada. The son of that
last was Saunaka,’ who first established the
distinctions of the four castes.* The son of
Kaga was Kasiraja;) his son was
Dirghatamas;'° his son was Dhanvantari,
whose nature was exempt from human
infirmities and who in every existence had
been master of universal knowledge. In his
past life (or when he was produced by the
agitation of the milky sea), Narayana had
conferred upon him the boon, that he should
subsequently be born in the family of Kasiraja,
should compose the eight-fold system of
medical science'' and should be thereafter
entitled to a share of offerings made to the
gods. The son of Dhanvantari was Ketumat;
his son was Bhimaratha; his son was
Divodasa;"” his son was Pratarddana, so named
from destroying the race of Bhadrasrenya. He
had various other appellations, as Satrujit, ‘the
victor over his foes,’ from having vanquished
all his enemies; Vatsa, or 'child', from his
father's frequently calling him by that name;
Ritadhvaja, ‘he whose emblem was truth,'
being a great observer of veracity; and
Kuvalayasva, because he had a horse (aSsva)
called Kuvalaya.” The son of this prince was
Alarka, of whom this verse is sung in the
present day; “For sixty thousand and sixty
hundred years no other youthful monarch
except Alarka, reigned over the earth.""*
