Raji had five hundred sons, all of
unequalled daring and vigour. Upon the
occurrence of a war between the demons and
the gods, both parties inquired of Brahma
which would be victorious. The deity replied,
"That for which Raji shall take up arms."
Accordingly the Daityas immediately repaired
to Raji, to secure his alliance; which he
promised them, if they would make him their
Indra after defeating the gods. To this they
answered and said, "We cannot profess one
thing and mean another; our Indra is Prahlada
and it is for him that we wage war." Having
thus spoken, they departed; and the gods then
came to him on the like errand. He proposed to
them the said conditions and they agreed that
he should be their Indra.
