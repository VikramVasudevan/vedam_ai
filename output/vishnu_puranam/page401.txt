350 THE VISNU-PURANAM

These were the descendants of Ksatravrddha. I
will now mention those of Nahusa.

NOTES

1. The Matsya says he taught the sons of Raji the
Jinadharma or Jain religion ; जिनधर्म्म समास्थाय वेदवाह्यं
स वेदवित्।

2. The Bhadgavata enumerates however, as his
descendants, Rabhasa, Gambhira and Akriya,
whose posterity became Brahmanas. The same
authority gives as the descendants of Anenas the
fourth son of Ayus, Suddha, Suci, Trikakud and
Santakhya.

3. The Vayu agrees with our text in making
Pratipaksa (Pratiksatra) the son of Ksattravrddha;
but the Brahma Purana and Hari Varhsa consider
Anenas to be the head of this branch of the
posterity of Ayus. The Bhagavata substitutes Kuga,
the Lesa of our text, the grandson of Ksatravrddha,
for the first name; and this seems most likely to be
correct. Although the different MSS, agree in
reading क्षत्रवृद्धसुत: it should be perhaps क्षात्रवृद्ध। the
patronymic Ksatravrddha; making then, as the
Bhagavata does, Pratiksatra the son of Kg
atravrddha.

4. Jaya : Bhagavata, Vayu.

5. Vijaya : Vayu, Krta : Bhagavata.

6. Haryasva : Brahma, Hari Varisa Haryavana :
Bhagavata.

7. The last of the list : Vayu, Ahina : Bhagavata.

8. Ksatravrddha : Brahma, Hari Varhéa.
