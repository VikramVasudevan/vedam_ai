Yati, Yayati, Sanyati, Ayati, Viyati and
Krti were the six valiant sons of Nahusa.! Yati
declined the sovereignty’ and Yayati therefore
succeeded to the throne. He had two wives,
Devayani, the daughter of Usanas and Sarmist
ha, the daughter of Vrsaparvan; of whom this
genealogical verse is recited : "Devayani bore
two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. Sarmistha, the
daughter of Vrsaparvan, had three sons,
Druhyu, Anu and Puru."* Through the curse of
Usanas, Yayati became old and infirm before
his time; but having appeased his father-in-
law, he obtained permission to transfer his
decrepitude to any one who would consent to
take it. He first applied to his eldest son Yadu,
and said, "Your maternal grandfather has
brought this premature decay upon me; by his
permission, however, I may transfer it to you
for a thousand years. I am not yet satiate with
worldly enjoyments and wish to partake of
them through the means of your youth. Do not
refuse compliance with my request." Yadu,
however, was not willing to take upon him his
father's decay; on which his father denounced
an imprecation upon him and said, "Your
posterity shall not possess dominion.”
