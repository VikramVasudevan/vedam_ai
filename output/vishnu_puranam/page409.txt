Krostri, the son of Yadu,' had a son named
Vrijinivat’; his son was Svahi’; his son was
Rusardru’; his son was Citraratha; his son was
Sasavindu, who was lord of the fourteen great
gems’; he had a hundred thousand wives and a
million of sons.®° The most renowned of them
were Prthuyasas, Prthukarman, Prthujaya,
Prthukirtti, Prthudina and Prdhusravas. The
son of the last of these six’? was Tamas’; his
son was Usanas’, who celebrated a hundred
sacrifices of the horse; his son was Siteyus'’;
his son was Rukmakavaca!'; his son was
Pardvrt, who had five sons, Rukmesu,
Prthurukman, Jyamagha, Palita and Harita.'?
To this day the following verse relating to
Jyamagha is repeated :

भार्यावशास्तु ये केचिद् भविष्यन्तथवा मृता:।

तेषान्तु ज्यामघ: श्रेष्ठ शैव्यापतिरभून्नृप:।

अपुत्रा तस्य सा पत्नी शैव्या नाम तथाप्यसौ।

अपत्यकामोऽपि भयान्नान्यां भार्य्यमविन्दत।।

"Of all the husbands submissive to their
wives, who have been or who will be, the most
eminent is the king Jyamagha'’, who was the
husband of Saivya." Saivya was barren; but
Jyamagha was so much afraid of her, that he
did not take any other wife.
