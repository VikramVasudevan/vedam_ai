३58 THE VISNU-PURANAM

princes of Boghelkhanda and Chandail and
Dasarha, more correctly perhaps Dasarna,
Chhattisghar; so that this story of Jyamagha's
adventures appears to allude to the first settlement
of the Yadava tribes along the Narmada more to the
south and west than before.

14. The Bhagavata has Kusa; the Matsya,
Kausika : all the authorities agree in specifying
three sons.

15, Lomapada : Agni.

16. Vastu : Vayu. Krti : Agni.

17. Ahuti ; Vayu. Iti : Padma. Dyuti : Matsya.
Bhrti : Kirma. This latter is singular in carrying on
the line of Romapada for twelve generations
further.

18. The Bhagavata, however, makes the princes
of Cedi continuous from Romapada; as, Babhru,
Dhrti, Usika, Cedi - the Caidyas, amongst whom
were Damaghoga and Sigupala.

19, Kumbhi ; Padma.

20. Dhrsta : Vayu. Dhrsti : Matsya.

21, Nivrtti ; Vayu. Nidhrti ; Agni. The Brahma
makes thrce sons, Avanta, Dagarha and Balivrs
ahan. In the Linga it is said of Dasarha that he was
ताम्रारिगण सूदन:। ‘destroyer of the host of copper
(faced; European?) foes.'

22. Vikala : Matsya.

23. Nararatha : Brahma and Hari Varnsa.

24. Drdharatha : Agni. Devarata : Linga.

25. Soma : Linga. Devanaksatra : Padma.

26. There is great vareity in the succeeding
appellations :

BhagavataVayu Brahma Matsya Padma Kirma
Madhu Madhu Madhu Madhu Madhu Madhu
Kuruvasa Manu ManavasasUruvas Puru Kuru
Anu Puruvatsa Purudvat PurudvatPunarvasuAnu
PuruhotraPurudvat [Mat Jantu. Jantu Ansa
Ayu Satva and Satva
Satvata Satvata  Satvata  Satvata Satvata Andhaka
Satvata

The Linga has Purusaprabhu, Manvat,
Pratarddana, Satvata; and the Agni, Dravavasu,
Puruhuta, Jantu and Satvata. Some of these
originate, no doubt, in the blunders of copyists, but
they cannot all be referred to that source.
