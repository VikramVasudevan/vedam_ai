BOOK IV, 15 371

12. Vata, Nivata, Samin ; Vayu.

13. Sondgva : Matsya. Sonaksa : Padma. Sini ;
Bhagavata.

14. Bhojaka : Agni. Bhoja : Padma.

15. Ten sons : Matsya.

16. Devarha : Vayu, Padma, Agni and Matsya;
and a different series follows or Kambalavarhisa,
Asamaujas, Samaujas, Sudanstra, Suvasa, Dhrsta,
Anamitra, Nighna, Satrajit. They all make
Vasudeva the son of Siira, however; but the three
first leave it doubtful whether that Stra was the son
of Bhajam4na or not. The Bhagavata and Brahma
agree with the text, which is probably correct. The
Brahma has Sira, son of Devamidhusa, although it
does not specify the latter amongst the sons of
Hridika.

17. Anaka a larger and Dundubhi a smaller
drum.

18. The Mahabharata is the best authority for
these circumstances.

19. The Padma calls him king of Kashmir.

20. The Brahma Purana and Hari Varhsa make
Srutadeva mother of Sisupala and Prthukirtti of
Dantavaktra.
