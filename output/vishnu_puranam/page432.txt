इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे agaist षोडश: seat:

Pardsara said—I shall now summarily give
you an account of the descendants of Turvasu.

The son of Turvasu was Vahni;! his son
was Gobhanu;’ his son was Traigdmba;? his
son was Karandhama; his son was Marutta.
Marutta had no children and he therefore
adopted Dusyanta, of the family of Puru; by
which the line of Turvasu merged into that of
Puru.’ This took place in consequence of the
malediction denounced on his son by Yayati.”
