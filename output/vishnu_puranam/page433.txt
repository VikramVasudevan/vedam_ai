BOOK IV, 18 375

NOTES

1. Varga ; Agni.

2. Bhanumat ; Bhagavata, which also inserts
Bhaga before him.

3. Tribhanu : Vayu. Trisanu : Brahma. Traisali :
Agni. Trisari : Matsya.

4. Besides Bharata, who, as will be hereafter
seen, was the son of Dusyanta, the Vayu, Matsya,
Agni and Brahma Puranas enumerate several
descendants in this line, for the purpose evidently
of introducing, as the posterity of Turvasu, the
nations of the south of India : the series is Varuttha,
(Karutthima, Brahma), Andira (Akrira, Brahma);
whose sons are Pandya, Karata, Cola, Kerala; the
Hari Varnsa adds Kola and the Agni very
incorrectly Gandhara.

5. The curse alluded to is the failure of his line
(Prajasamuccheda), denounced upon Turvasu as the
punishment of refusing to take his father's
infirmities upon him (see Bk. IV. Ch. XI). He was
also sentenced to rule over savages and barbarians,
Mlecchas or people not Hindus. The Mahabharata
adds that thc Yavanas sprang from Turvasu. As
sovereign of the south-east, he should be the
ancestor of the people of Arakan, Ava; but the
authorities cited in the preceding note refer the
nations of the Peninsula to him and consequently
consider them as Mlecchas; and these and similar
passages indicate a period prior to the introduction
of Hinduism into the south of India.
