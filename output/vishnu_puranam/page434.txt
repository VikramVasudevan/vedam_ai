The son of Druhyu was Babhru; his son
was Setu; his son was Aradvat;' his son was
Gandhara;” his son was Dharma;’ his son was
Dhrita;* his son was Duryaman;° his son was
Pracetas, who had a hundred sons and they
were the princes of the lawless Mlecchas or
barbarians of the north.°

NOTES

1. Also Araddha in MSS., and Aratta, Matsya,
which last seems to be the preferable reading. The
Vayu has Aruddha; the Brahma, Angarasetu; but
Aratta is a northern country, contiguous to or
synonymous with, Gandhara.

2. Of Gandhira it is said in the Vayu that it is a
large country named after him and is famous for its
breed of horses : ख्यायते तस्य नाम्ना तु महान्।
TER देशजाश्चापि gen वाजिनां वरा:॥ The Matsya reads
the beginning of the second line,
showing that Aratta and Gandhara are much Me
same, See Bk. IT. Ch. III. 1.83.

3. The Brahma Purana and Hari VarhSa, in
opposition to all the rest, make Dharma and his
successors the descendants of Anu.

4, Ghrta : Agni.

5. Durddama : Vayu and Bhagavata. The
Matsya, Brahma and Agni insert a Vidupa, Duduha
or Vidula, before Pracetas.

6. So the Bhagavata and Matsya. The
Mahabharata says the descendants of Durhya are
the Vaibhojas, a people unacquainted with the use
of cars or beasts of burden and who travel on rafts ;
they have no kings.
