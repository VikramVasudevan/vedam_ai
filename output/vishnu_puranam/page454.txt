BOOK IV, 23 391

21. Ksulika : Vayu. Kulaka or Ksullaka :
Matsya. Omitted : Bhagavata. In the Mahavira
Caritra, a work written by the celebrated
Hemacandra, in the twelfth century, we have a
Prasenajit, king of Magadha, residing at Rajgrha,
succeeded by Srenika and he by Kilika. The
Buddhists have a Prasenajit contemporary with
Sakya, son of Mahapadma, king of Magadha. There
is some confusion of persons wither in the Pauranik
genealogies or in the Buddhist and Jain traditions,
but they agree in brining the same names together
about the same period.

22. Omitted ; Bhagavata.

23. The Vayu and Bhagavata have the same
stanza. We have here twenty-nine or thirty princes
of the later solar line, contemporary with the
preceding twenty-six or twenty-seven of the later
dynasty of the moon.,
