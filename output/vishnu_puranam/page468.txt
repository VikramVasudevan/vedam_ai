Bhimimitra, 14, Narayana, 12 and Susarman, 10.
Total - 45. And six copies of the Matsya concur in
this statement.

39.The expressions Andhrajatiyas and
Andharbhrtyas have much perplexed Wilford, who
makes three races out of one Andhras,
Andharjatiyas and Andharbhrtyas. As. Res. IX. 101.
There is no warrant for three races in the Puranas,
although the Matsya and perhaps the Va4yu,
distinguishes two, as we shall hereafter see. Our
text has but one, to which all the terms may be
applied, The first of the dynasty was an Andhra by
birth or caste (jatiya) and servant (bhrtyas) of the
last of the Kanva reace. So the Vayu;
सिन्धुकोह्यन्ध्रजातीय:। the Matsya; काण्वायनस्तदा भृत्य: Arai
yee तं शिशुकोऽन्थ्र: सजातीय: प्रप्स्यतीमां वसुन्धरां and the
Bhagavatas; हइत्वाकाण्वं सुशर्म्मणं तद्मृत्यौ वृषलो ach गां
भोक्ष्यत्यन्ध्रजातीय: कंचित्कालंमसत्रम्। The terms 'an Andhra by
caste' and 'a Bhrtya or srvant,' with the additon, in
the last passage, of Vrsala, ‘a Sidra,’ all apply to
one person and one dynasty. Wilfor has made wild
work with his triad. The name of the first of this
race is variously read : Sindhuka, Vayu; Sisuka,
Matsya; Balin, Bhagavata; and according to Wilfor,
Chismaka in the Brahmanda P. and Stdraka or
Straka in the Kumariké Khanda of the Skanda
Purana As. Res. TX. 107. He reigned 23 years, Vayu
and Matsya. If the latter form of his name be
correct, he may be the king who is spoken of in the
prologue to the Mrcchakati.

63. The Vayu and Bhagavata state also 30 Kings
and 456 years; the Matsya has 29 kings and 460
years. The actual enumeration of the text gives but
24 names; that of the Bhagavata but 23; that of the
Vayu but 17. The Matsya has the whole 29 names,
adding several to the list of our text; and the
aggregate of the rcigns amounts of 435 years and 6
months. The difference between this and the total
specified arises probaly from some inaccuracy in
the MSS. As this list appears to be fuller than any
other, it may be advisable to insert it as it occurs in
the Radcliffe copy of the Matsya Purana -

1. Siguka, 23 years, 2. Krsna, 18, 3. Simalakarni,

month. Several of the names vary in this list from
those in my copy. The adjuncts Svati and Satikarna
appear to be conjoined or not with the other
appellations, according to the convenience of the
metre and seem to be the family designations or
titles. The dynasty is of considerable chronological
interest, as it admits of some plausible verifications.
