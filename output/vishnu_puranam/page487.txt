BOOK V, CHAP. 3 - 421

comprised in him who is their eternal lord and
the object of all apprehension; whose real
form, nature, name and dimensions are not
within human apprehension-are now with that
Visnu in you.

त्वं स्वाहा त्वं स्वधा विद्या gai त्वं ज्योतिरम्बरे।

त्वं सर्वलोकरक्षार्थमवत्तीर्णा महीतले॥ २०॥

wate देवि। सर्वस्य जगत: शं YT! कुरु।

Ker त्वं धारयेशानं धृतं येनाखिलं जगत्।। २१॥

You are Svaha; you are Svadhaé; you are
wisdom, ambrosia, light and heaven. You have
descended upon earth for the preservation of
the world. Have compassion upon us, O
goddess and do good unto the world. Be proud
to bear that deity by whom the universe is
upheld.’

NOTES

1. It is mentioned in the preceding chapter that
they were all put to death, in which the Hari Varhéa
concurs. The Bhagavata makes Karhsa spare them
and restore them to their parents, as he had nothing
to apprehend from their existence.
