BOOK V, CHAP. 4 423

इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे पञ्चमांशे तृतीय: अध्याय:।

Vasudeva, bearing off the female infant of
YaSoda , reached his mansion unobserved and
entered and placed the child in the bed of
Devaki : he then remained as usual. The
guards were awakened by the cry of the new-
born baby and, starting up, they sent word to
Karhsa that Devaki had borne a child. Karhsa
immediately repaired to the residence of
Vasudeva, where he seized upon the infant. In
vain Devaki convulsively entreated him to
relinquish the child : he threw it ruthlessly
against a stone; but it rose into the sky and
expanded into a gigantic figure, having eight
arms, each wielding some formidable weapon.
This terrific being laughed aloud and said to
Karhsa, ‘‘What avails it you, Karnsa, to have
hurled me to the ground? He is born who shall
kill you, the mighty one amongst the gods,
who was formerly your destroyer. Now
quickly secure him and provide for your own
welfare.’’ Thus having spoken, the goddess,
decorated with heavenly perfumes and
garlands and hymned by the spirits of the air,
vanished from before the eyes of Bhoja raja.”

NOTES

1. The Bhagavata more consistently makes
Vasudeva find Nanda and the rest fast asleep in
their houses and subsequently describes their
bringing tribute or tax (kara) to Kamsa.

2. Chief of the tribe of Bhoja. a branch of the
Yadavas : see Bk. IV. Ch. XIII.
