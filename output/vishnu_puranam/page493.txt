When Vasudeva was set at liberty, he went
to the wagon of Nanda and found Nanda there
rejoicing that a son was born to him.’ Vasu-
deva spoke to him kindly and congratulated
him on having a son in his old age. ‘‘The
yearly tribute,’’ he added, “has been paid to
the king and men of property should not tarry
near the court, when the business that brought
them there has been transacted. Why do you
delay, now that your affairs are settled? Up,
Nanda, quickly and set off to your own
pastures; and let this boy, the son whom
Rohini has borne me, accompany you and be
brought up by you as this your own son.”’
