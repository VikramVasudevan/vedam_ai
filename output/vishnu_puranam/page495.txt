426 THE VISNU-PURANAM

spirits malignant and unfriendly, ever fly you,
appalled by the bow, the discus, mace and
sword of Visnu and the echo of his shell. May
Vaikuntha guard you in the cardinal points;
and in the intermediate ones, Madhusidana.
May RsikeSa defend you in the sky and
Mahidhara upon earth.’’ Having pronounced
this prayer to avert all evil, Nanda put the
child to sleep in his bed underneath the
waggon. Beholding the vase carcass of Putana,
the cowherds were filled with astonishment
and terror.

NOTES

1. It is literally ‘went to the cart’ or ‘waggon ;’
नन्दस्य Wad Ta: (as if Nanda and his family dwelt in
such a vehicle, as the Scythians are said to have
done. The commentator explains Sakata (शकट) the
place of loosing or unharnessing the waggon;
शकटावमोचनस्थानं। In the Bhagavata, Vasudeva does not
quit Mathura, but goes to the halting ground of
Nanda, who has come to that city to pay his taxes :
ययौ तदवमोचनं। explained by the comment, तस्य वसतिस्थानं।

2. In the Hari Varhga this female fiend is
described as coming in the shape ofa bird.

3. The Raksa, the preserver or preservative
against charms, is a piece of thread or silk or some
more costly material, bound round the wrist or arm,
with an appropriate prayer such as that in the text.
Besides its application to children, to avert the
effects of evil eyes or to protect them against Dains
or witches, there is one day in the year, the Rakhi
Pirnima or full moon in the month of Sravana
(July-August), when it is bound upon the wrists of
adults by friendly or kindred Brahmanas, with a
short prayer or benediction. The Rakhi is also sent
sometimes by persons of distinction and especially
by females, to members of a different family or
even race and nation, to intimate a sort of brotherly
or sisterly adoption. Tod’s Rajasthan, I. 312.
