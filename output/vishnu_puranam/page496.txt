On one occasion, whilst Madhusiidana was
asleep underneath the waggon, he cried for the
breast and kicking up his feet he overturned
the vehicle and all the pots and pans were
upset and broken. The cowherds and their
wives, hearing the noise, came exclaiming,
‘‘Ah ! ah !’’ and there they found the child
sleeping on his back. ‘‘Who could have upset
the waggon ?’’ said the cowherds. ‘‘This
child,” replied some boys, who witnessed the
circumstance; ‘‘we saw him,’’ said they,
‘crying and kicking the waggon with his feet
and so it was overturned: no one else had any
thing to do with it.’’ The cowherds were
exceedingly astonished at this account; and
Nanda, not knowing what to think, took up the
boy; whilst Yasoda4 offered worship to the

broken pieces of pots and to the waggon, with
curds, flowers, fruit and unbruised grain.
