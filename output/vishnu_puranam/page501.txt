THE VISNU-PURANAM

अधिरुह्योत्पतिष्यामि ह्रदेऽस्मिन्ननिलाशिन:। 201

One day Krsna, unaccompanied by Rama,
went to Vrndavan : he was attended by a troop
of cowherds and gaily decorated with wild
flowers. On his way he came to the Yamuna,
which was flowing in sportive undulations and
sparkling with foam, as if with smiles, as the
waves dashed against the borders. Within its
bed, however, was the fearful pool of the
serpent Kaliya, boiling with the fires of
poison;! from the fumes of which, large trees
upon the bank were blighted and by whose
waters, when raised by a gale into the air,
birds were scorched. Beholding tills dreadful
lake, which was like another mouth of death,
Madhusiidana reflected that the wicked and
poisonous K4liya, who had been vanquished
by himself (in the person of Garuda) and had
been obliged to fly from the ocean (where he
had inhabited the island Ramanaka), must be
lurking at its bottom and defiling the Yamuna,
the consort of the sea, so that neither men nor
cattle could slake their thirst by her waters.
Such being the case, he determined to dislodge
the Naga and enable the dwellcrs of Vraja to
frequent the vicinage without fear; for it was
the especial purpose he considered of his
descent upon earth to reduce to subjection all
such violators of law. ‘‘Here’’ thought he, ‘‘is
a Kadamba tree, which is sufficiently near; I
can climb up it and thence leap into thc
serpcnt’s pool.”’
