Having thus resolved, he bound his clothes
tightly about him and jumped boldly into the
lake of the serpent-king. The waters, agitated
by his plunge amidst them, were scattered to a
considerable distance from the bank and the
spray falling upon the trees, they were
immediately set on fire by the heat of the
poisonous vapour combined with the water;
and the whole horizon was in a blaze. Krsna,
having dived into the pool, struck his arms in
defiance” and the snake-king, hearing the
sound, quickly came forth: his eyes were
coppery red and his hoods were flaming with
deadly venom : he was attended by many other
powerful and poisonous snakes, feeders upon
air and by hundreds of serpent-nymphs, de-
corated with rich jewels, whose earrings
glittered with trembling radiance as_ the
wearers” moved along. Coiling themselves
around Krsna, they all bit him with teeth from
which fiery poison was emitted. Krsna’s
companions, beholding him in the lake,
encompassed by the snakes, twining around
him, ran off to Vraja, lamenting and bewailing
aloud his fate. ‘‘Krsna,’’ they called out, ‘‘has
foolishly plunged into the’serpent’s pool and is
there bitten to death by the snake-king! Come
and see.””

The cowherds and their wives and Yasoda,
hearing this news, which was like a
thunderbolt, ran immediately to the pool,
frightened out of their senses and crying,
“*Alas ! alas ! where is he ?’’ The Gopis were
retarded by Yasod4, who in her agitation
stumbled and slipped at every step; but Nanda
and the cowherds and the invincible Rama
hastened to the banks of the Yamuna, eager to
assist Krsna.

here they beheld him apparently in the
power of the serpent-king, encompassed by
twining snakes and making no effort to escape.
Nanda, as soon as he set his eyes upon his son,
became senseless; and Yasoda also, when she
beheld him, lost all consciousness.

The Gopis, overcome with sorrow, wep:
