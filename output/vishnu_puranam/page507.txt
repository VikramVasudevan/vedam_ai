THE VISNU-PURANAM

this grove, belonging to the great Dhenuka, the
trees are loaded with ripe fruit, the smell of
which perfumes the air : we should like to eat
some, will you throw some down?’’ As soon
as the boys had spoken, Sarhkarsana and Krs
na shook the trees and brought down the fruit
on the ground.

फलानां पततां शब्दमाकर्ण्य स दुरासद:।
आजगाम सुदुष्टात्मा कोपाद् दैतेयगर्द्दभ: ॥७॥
पद्भ्यामुभाभ्यां स तदा पश्चिमाभ्यां बली बलम्।

जघानोरसि ताभ्याञ्च स च तेनाप्यगृह्यत ic it
गृहीत्वा भ्रामणेनैव सोऽम्बरे गतजीवितम्।
तस्मिन्नेव च चिक्षेप ane तृणराजनि॥ ९॥

तत: फलान्यनेकानि तालाग्रान्निपतन् खर:।
पृथिव्यां पातयामास महाव्रातोऽम्बुदानिव ॥ १०॥

अन्यानप्यस्य रै ज्ञातीनागतान् दैत्यगर्ददभान्।

OUTTA तालाग्रे बलभद्रश्च लीलया॥ ११॥

क्षणेनालङ्कृता WAT पकेस्तालफलैस्तथा।

दैत्यगर्द्दभदेहैश्च मैत्रेय! शुशुभेऽधिकम्॥ १२॥

ततो गावो निराबाधास्तस्मिंस्तालवने द्विज।

नवशस्यं सुखं चेरूर्यन्नं भुक्तमभूत् पुरा ॥१३॥

इति श्रीविषणुपुराणे पञ्चमांशे अष्टम: SATU

Hearing the noise of the falling fruit, the
fierce and malignant demon Dhenuka, in the
form of an ass, hastened to the spot in a great
passion and began to kick Rama on the breast
with his hinder heels. Rama, however, seized
him by both hind legs and whirling him round
until he expired, tossed his carcass to the top
of a palm tree, from the branches of which it
struck down abundance of fruit, like rain drops
poured upon earth by the wind. The animals
that were of kin to Dhenuka came running to
his aid; but Krsna and Rama treated them in
the same manner, until the trees were laden
with dead asses and the ground was strewed
with ripe fruit. Henceforward the cattle grazed
unobstructed in the palm grove and cropped
the new pasturage, where they had never
before ventured’.

NOTES
1. This exploit is related in the Bhagavata, Hari
Varga and other Vaisnava Puranas, much in the
same strain, but not always in the same place : it
more commonly precedes the legend of the
discomfiture of Kaliya.
