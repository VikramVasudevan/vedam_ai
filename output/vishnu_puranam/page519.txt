defended from the wind : enter without delay
and fear not that the mountain will fall.’ Upon
this, all the people, with their herds and their
wagons and goods and the Gopis, distressed
by the rain, repaired to the shelter of the
mountain, which Krsna held steadily over their
heads; and Krsna, as he supported the
mountain, was contemplated by the dwellers
of Vraja with joy and wonder; and, as their
eyes opened wide with astonishment and
pleasure, the Gopas and Gopis sang his praise.
For seven days and nights did the vast clouds
sent by Indra rain upon the Gokula of Nanda
to destroy its inhabitants, but they were
protected by the elevation of the mountain;
and the slayer of Bala, Indra, being foiled in
his purpose, commanded the clouds to cease.
The threats of Indra having been fruitless and
the heavens clear, all Gokula came forth from
its shelter and returned to its own abode. Then
Krsna, in the sight of the surprised inhabitants
of the forests, restored the great mountain
Govardhana to its original site.'

NOTES

‘1. It seems not unlikely that this legend has some
reference to the caves or cavern temples in various
parts of India. A remarkable representation of it
occurs upon the sculptured rocks of Mahabalipura.
It is related much to the same purport in the
Bhagavata. Sisupala, ridiculing the exploit, asserts
that Govardhana was nothing more than an ant hill.
