ParéSara-Syala having called Gargya the
Brahman, whilst at the cow-pens, impotent, in
an assembly of the Yadavas, they all laughed;
at which he was highly offended, and repaired
to the shores of the western sea, where be
engaged in arduous penance to obtain a son,
who should be terror to the tribe of Yadu.
Propitiating Mahadeva, and living upon iron
sand for twelve years, the deity at last was
pleased with him, and gave him the desired
boon. The king of the Yavanas, who was
childless, became the friend of Gargya; and
the latter begot a son by his wife, who was as
black as a bee, and was thence called
Kalayavana'.
