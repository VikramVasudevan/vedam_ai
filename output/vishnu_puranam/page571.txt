BOOK V, CHAP. 26 485

रेवतीं नाम तनयां रैवतस्य महीपते:।
उपयेमे बलस्तस्यां जज्ञाते निशठोल्मुकौ।। १९॥
_इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे पञ्चमांशे पञ्चविंश: अध्याय:।
Thus decorated, Rama spotted two months
in Vraja, and then returned to Dvarak4, where
he married Revati, the daughter of king

Raivata, by whom he had two sons, Nisatha
and Ulmuka.*

NOTES

1 The great serpent, of whom Balarama is an
incarnation.

2 There is no vinous exudation from the
Kadamba tree (Nauclea Kadamba), but its flowers
are said to yield a spirit by distillation ; whence
Kadambari is one the synonyms of wine, or
Spiritous liqour. The grammarians, however, also
derive the word from some legend, stating it to be
so called because it was praduced from the hollow
of a Kadamba tree on the Gomantha mountain:
गोमन्थपर्व्वते कदम्बकोटराज्जाता। The Hari Vamsa. which
alone makes the Gomantha mountain the scene of
an exploit of Krsna and Rama, makes no mention
of this origin of wine; and the Bhagavata merely
says that Varuni took up her abode in the hollow of
a tree. There must be some other authority therefore
for this story.

3 The Bhagavata and Hari Varhsa repeat this
story; the latter very imperfectly : the former adds,
that the Yamund‘is still to be seen following the
course along which she was dragged by Balarama.
The legend probably alludes to the construction of
canals from the Jumna, for the purposes of
irrigation; and the works of the Mohammedans in
this way, which are well known, were no doubt
preceded by similar canals dug by order of Flindu
princes. 4 See Bk. IV. Ch. XIV.
