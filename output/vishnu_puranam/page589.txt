न चापि सर्ग-संहार-स्थितिकर्त्तखिलस्य य:।

जितस्य तेन मे ब्रीडा जायते विश्वरूपिणा।। ७७॥

यस्मिन् जगत् सकलमेददनादिमध्ये

यस्माद् यतश्च न भविष्यति सर्वभूतात्।
तेनोद्भव-प्रलय-पालनकारणेन
व्रीडा कथं भवति देवि! निराकृतस्य।।७८॥

Thus spoken to by Satyabhama, the king of
the gods turned back, and said to her, “Desist,
wrathful dame, from afflicting your friend by
further reproaches. I am not ashamed of being
vanquished by him who is the author of the
creation, preservation, and destruction ‘of the
world; who is the substance of all things; in
whom, without beginning or middle, the
universe is comprised; and from whom, and by
whom, identical with all things, it proceeds,
and will cease to be. What disgrace is it, O
goddess, to any one to be discomfited by him
who is the cause of creation, continuance, and
dissolution ?

सकलभुवनसूतेर्मुर्तिरस्यानुसूक्ष्मां
विदितसकलवेदैर्जायते यस्य नान्यै:।
शं 1 स्वेच्छयैनं
argued को विजेतु समर्थ:।॥७९॥
इति श्रीविष्णुपुराणे पञ्चमांशे त्रिंश: अध्याय:।।

His form is the parent of all worlds, though
infiitely subtle, and known to those only by
whom all that may be known is known. Who
is able to overcome the unborn, unconstituted,
eternal lord, who has willed to become a
mortal for the good of the world ?"'

NOTES
1 The Bhagavata merely says. “Incited by his

wife, Krsna look away the P4arijata tree, having.

subdued the gods, and planted it in the garden of
Satyabhama, The Hari V. makes a long story of it,
and tells it with some variations, especially in the
commencement, Satyabhima's desire for the
Parijita tree having been excited by Narada's
presenting a flower from it to Krsna’s other spouse.
Rukmini.
