The companion and friend of the princess
was Chitralekha, the daughter to Kubhanda,
the minister of Bana. “Of whom do you speak
?” Inquired she of Usa. But the princess,
recollecting herself, was ashamed, and
remained silent. At length, however,
Chitralekha conciliated her confidence, and
she related to her what had passed, and what
the goddess had foretold; and she requested
her friend to devise some means of uniting her
with the person whom she had bcheld in her
dream.

Citralekha then delineated the most
eminent gods, demons, spirits, and mortals,
and showed them to Usa. Putting aside the
portraits to gods, spirits, snake-gods, and
demons, the princess selected those of mortals,
and amongst them the heroes of the races of

Andhaka and Vrisni. When she came to the

likenesses of Krsna and Rama, she was

confused with shame; from the portrait of

Pradyumna she modestly averted her eyes; but

the moment she beheld the picture of his son,

the object of her passion, her eyes wide
expanded, and all her bashfulness was
discarded. “This is he! this is he!’ said she to

Citralekha; and her friend, who was endowed

with magic power, bade her be of good cheer,

and sec off through the air to Dvaraka.

had ten sons, and gives the ten names to each set,
with one or two exceptions.
