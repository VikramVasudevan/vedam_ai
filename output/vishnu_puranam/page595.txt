502 THE VISNU-PURANAM

CHAPTER 33
त्रयस्रिंशोऽध्याय:
(कृष्ण-वाणासुरयो: सङ्घाम:)

पराशर Jaret

बाणोऽपि पणिपत्याग्रे मैत्रेयाह त्रिलोचनम्।

देव! बाहुसहस्रेण निर्विण्णोऽहं विनाहवम्।। १॥

क्वचिन्ममेषां बाहूनां साफल्यजनको रण:।

भविष्यति विना युद्धं भारायं मम किं भुजै:।। २॥

Before this took place, Bana had been
engaged in the adoration of the three-eyed
god, and had thus prayed to him: “I am
humiliated, O lord, by the possession of a
thousand arms in a state of peace; let some
hostilities ensue, in which I may derive some
advantage from their possession. Without war,

what is the use to these arms ? They are but a
burden to me.”

श्रीशङ्कर उवाच
मयूरध्वजभङ्गस्ते यदा बाण। भविष्यति।
पिशितशिजनानान्दं प्राप्स्यसे त्वं तदा रणम्॥ ३॥
Sankara replied, “When thy peacock
banner shall be broken, you shall have war, the

delight of the evil spirits that feast on the flesh
to man.”

पराशर उवाच
तत: प्रणम्य मुदित: शम्भुमभ्यागतो गृहम्।
भग्नञ्च ध्वजमालोक्य EH हर्षान्तरं ययौ॥४॥

Bana, pleased by this promise, proffered
his thanks to Sambhu, and returned to his
palace, where he found his standard broken; at
which his joy was increased.

एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु योगविद्याबलेन तम्।
अनिरुद्धमथानिन्ये चित्रलेखा वराप्सरा:॥५॥
