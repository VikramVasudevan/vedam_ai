3. Counting according to this mode of
enumeration, a Parardha is represented by
100,000,000,000,000,000. The Vayu Purana has a
term for each of these decimal values. Dasa (<1),
10; Satam (af), 100; Sahasram (are), 1000;
Ayutam (344), 10,000; Niyutam (faq), 100,000;
Prayutam (34a), 1,000,000; Arvudam (अर्बुदं),

10,000,000; Nyurvudam (न्युर्बुर्दं),
100,000,000;Vrindam (4%), 1000,000,000; Param
CR), 10,000,000,000;  Kharvam (@a),
100,000,000,000; Nikharvam
(frad),1000,000,000,000;  Sankham (शंखं),
10,000,000,000,000; Padmam (a1),
100,000,000,000,000; Samudram (aR),
1000,000,000,000; Madhyamam (मध्यमं),
10,000,000,000,000,000; Pararddham (पराद्धं),

100,000,000,000,000,000. In the first book the
Pararddham, as the half of Brahma’s life, it but
155,520,000,000,000 fifteen instead of eighteen
places of figures.

4. The description of the Clepsydra is very brief,
and wanting in precision. One of the commentaries
is more explicit: ‘A vessel made of twelve Palas
and half of copper, and holding a Prastha, Magadha
measure, of water, broad at top, and having at
bottom a tube of gold of four Mashas weight, four
fingers long, is placed in water, and the time in
which the vessel is filled by the whole in the
bottom is called a Nadika:’ सार्द्धद्वादशपलताम्नमयं
कृताषच्छिद्रं जलेस्थापितं तेनच्छिद्रेण यावता कालेन gait
तावत्कालो नाडिकेति। The term Salaka generally means
a needle or stake, but it must here denote a pipe.
The common measure of the Nadi is a thin shallow
brass cup, with a small hole in the bottom. It is
placed on the surface of water, in a large vessel,
where nothing can disturb it, and where the water
gradually fills the cup, and sinks it. As. Res. vol. V.
p. 87. ।

5. See Bk. II. Ch. XI. n. 3.

6. These also have their several appellations: the
commentator quotes the Vedas as the authority;
Araga, Bhraja, Patala, Pataiga, Svamabhak, Jyotis
mat, and Savibhasa.

7, The passage may also be understood. ‘Those
go to Janaloka who are desirous of obtaining
Brahma, or final liberation, through the ten stages
of perfection— devotion, penance, truth, etc.’ In the

Vayu Purana more details are specified. Those
sainted mortals who have diligently worshipped Vis
nu, and are distinguished for piety, abide, at the
time of dissolution, in Maharloka, with the Pitrs,
the Manus, the seven Rsis, the various orders of
celestial spirits, and the gods. These, when the heat
of the flames that destroy the worlds reaches to
Maharloka, repair to Janaloka in their subtile forms,
destined to become re-embodied, in similar
capacities as their former, when the world is
renewed, at the beginning of the succeeding Kalpa.
This continues throughout the life of Brahma; at the
expiration of his life all are destroyed: but those
who have then attained a residence in the
Brahmaloka, by having identified themselves in
spirit with the supreme, are finally resolved into the
sole-existing Brahma.
