BOOK VI, CHAP. 5 543

NOTES

1. The Naimittika Pralaya is described in the
Vayu, Bhagavata. Kiirma, and other Puranas, to the
same effect, and very commonly in precisely the
same words.

2. See Bk. I. Ch. II.

3. The Bhagavata notices the Prakrta pralaya
much more briefly, and it is omitted in the Vayu.
