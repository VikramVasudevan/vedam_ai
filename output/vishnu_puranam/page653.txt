So speaking, he went back to Kesidhwaja,
and said to him, “Is it true that you wish to
make me a gift, as to your preceptor?” “Indeed
I do,” answered Kesidhwaja. “Then,” rejoined
Khandikya, “as it is known that you are
learned in the spiritual learning that teaches
the doctrine of the soul, if you will
communicate that knowledge to me, you will
have discharged your debt to your instructor.
Declare to me what acts are efficacious for the

alleviation of human affliction.”

NOTES

1. Both study of the Vedas (Svadhyadya) and
abstraction (Yoga) are to be practised : when a man
is weary of one, he may apply to the other. The
Yoga, however, limits the practical part of silent
prayer. WORT: Weake ध्यानाच्छान्त: पुनर्जपेत्।
“Wearied of meditation, let him pray inaudibly:
weary of prayer, let him repeat meditation.’
जपध्यानाभियोगेन पश्येदात्मानमात्मनि। ‘By the union of
prayer and meditation Jet him behold soul in
himself.’

2. No such names occur amongst the Maithila
kings of the Visnu Purana (see Bk. IV. Ch. V.); but,
as there noticed (note 6), the Bhagavata inserts
them. Janaka is used as a title. Kriadhvaja, in some
of the copies, is read Ritadhwaja.

3. The performance of rites as a means of
salvation is called ignorance in the Vedas (see Bk.
VI. Ch. V. n. 7). Works are recommended as
introductory to the acquirement of knowledge: it is
ignorance to consider them as flnite.

4, Tasya-dhenum (तस्यधेनुं), Once copy has
Homa-dhenu, ‘cow of sacrifice;’? another, Dharma-
dhenu, ‘cow of righteousness.’ The commentator
explains the terms as importing the same thing, a
cow yielding milk for holy purposes, or for the
butter which is poured in oblations upon the
sacrificial fire.
