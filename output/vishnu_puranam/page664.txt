Having stated that embodied spirit (Ksetrajfia) is
the Kakranin, the possessor or user of the Karana,
which is knowledge, it adds, 74 तस्य `तत्। literally,
“by that, of that, that;’ ic. Tat, ‘that which is;’ and
Brahma, or supreme spirit, is the attainment of that
spirit which abides in body by that instrument, or
discriminative knowledge, of which it has become
possessed through perfect meditation: aaa: करणी
aw करणं dt wa तत्। fer aad af ga
कृत्यान्निवर्त्तते।। विज्ञानं निवर्त्तते।।

24. The commentator, in order to explain how
Khandikya should have -given what he did not
possess, states that it is to be understood that
Kesidhvaja relinquished to him the kingdom; or the
term Raja may denote merely, master of, or
acquainted with, mystic prayers, or Mantras: यद्वा

राजानं मन्त्रस्वामिनं कृत्वा।
