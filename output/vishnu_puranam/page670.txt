THE VISNU-PURANAM

May that unborn, eternal Hari, whose form
is manifold, and whose essence is composed
of both nature and spirit, bestow upon all
mankind that blessed state which knows
neither birth nor decay!

NOTES

!. The term is Brahmani layah (wef @a:),
which means, ‘a melting away,’ ‘a dissolution’ or
‘fusion,’ from the root Li (#4), ‘to liquefy,’ ‘to
melt,” ‘to dissolve.

2. Or with Visnu in the four modifications
described in the first section, spirit, matter, form,
and time: sce Bk. [. Ch. IL.

3. Or Sakti, noticed in the last chapter Ch. VII.

4, Or Bhavanas, also described in the preceding
section, Ch, VI.

5. This month is also called Jyesthamila, which
the commentator explains to mean, the month, of
which the root or cause (Mila) of being so called ts
the moon’s being full in the constellation Jyestha:
but it may be so termed, perhaps, from the lunar

asterism Mula, which is next to Jyestha, falling also
within the moon’s passage through the same
month.

6. This name is also read Tambamitra. One copy
has Tava-mitraya, ‘to thy friend,’ as if it was an
epithet of Dadhicha; but the construction of the
verse requires a proper name, ‘Bhaguri’ gave it to
Tambamitra, and he to Dadhici:’ भागुरिस्तंबमित्राय
दधीचाय स चोक्तवान्।

7. A different serics of narrators has been
specified in the first book, Bk. I. Ch. 1.

8. This seems to be an injudicious interpolation;
it is not in all the copies.

9. The words or prayers employed in presenting
oblations with fire.

10. The text has, यस्मिन् मानानि नो मानिनां निष्ठायै
प्रभवन्ति Mana commonly means ‘pride,’ but here it
seems most appropriately rendered by its radical
import ‘measure:’ the measures which are for the
determination of measurable things are not
applicable to Visnu. ।
