Vedavyasa said:

Of this garland of mantras (constituting) the praise-song of the
divine thousand names of Vishnu,

The blessed Vedavyasa is the seer,

Krishna, the Supreme Self, is the deity,

The metre is Anushtup,

"Having His source in the Self, Self-begotten" is the seed,

"The son of Devaka, the Creator and Sustainer," is the Power,
"He whose glory is sung in the three types of Sama songs; the
theme of such songs

He who manifests Himself as the Sama Veda" is the heart,

"The Bearer of the conch, He of the word, He of the discus" is the
nail,

"He of the Sharnga bow, the Wielder of the mace" is the weapon,
"The One holding the reins of a chariot in His hands (Krishna),
who is imperturbable" is the armour,

"The source, the vibration, God" is the supreme mantra

Let us engage ourselves in the japa of the divine thousand names
of Vishnu for the purpose of pleasing Great Vishnu.
