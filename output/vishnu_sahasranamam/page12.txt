I bow before that God, Vishnu,

Who is the lord of three worlds,
Who has earth as his feet,

Who has air as his soul,

Who has sky as his belly,

Who has moon and sun as eyes,
Who has the four directions as ears,
Who has the land of gods as head,
Who has fire as his mouth,

Who has sea as his stomach,

And in whose belly play and enjoy,
Gods, men birds, animals, Serpent men,
Gandharvas and Asuras.

विश्वाधारं गगनसदृशं मेघवर्णं शुभाङ्गम् |
वन्दे विष्णुं भवभयहरं सर्वलोकैकनाथम् ॥ ३॥

om samtakaram bhujagasayanam padmanabham surésam
visvadharam gaganasadrsam méghavarnam subhamgam,
laksmikamtam kamalanayanam yogihrddhyanagamyam
vamdeé visnum bhavabhayaharam sarvalokaikanatham. (3)

I bow before the God Vishnu,
Who is personification of peace,
Who sleeps on his folded arms,
Who has a lotus on his belly,
Who is the God of gods,

Who is the basis of earth,

Who is like the sky,

Who is of the colour of the cloud,
Who has beautiful limbs,

Who is the consort of Lakshmi,
Who has lotus like eyes,

Who is seen by saints through thought,
