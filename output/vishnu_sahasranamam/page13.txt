Who kills all worries and fears,
And who is the lord of all the worlds.

मेघश्यामं पीतकौशेयवासं

पुण्योपेतं पुण्डरीकायताक्षं

विष्णुं वन्दे सर्वलोकैकनाथम् ॥ ४॥
méghasyamam pitakauseyavasam
srivatsamkam kaustubhddbhasitamgam,

punyopetam pumdarikayataksam

visnum vamdé sarvalokaikanatham. (4)

I bow before that God Vishnu,

Who is the lord of all the universe,

Who is black like a cloud,

Who wears yellow silks,

Who has the sreevatsa on him,

Whose limbs shine because of Kousthubha,
Who has eyes like an open lotus,

And who is surrounded by the blessed always.

नम: समस्तभूतानामादिभूताय YU |
अनेकरूपरूपाय विष्णवे प्रभविष्णवे ॥ ५॥

namah samastabhutanamadibhutaya bhubhrte,
anekaruparupaya visnave prabhavisnave. (5)

Obeisance to Vishnu, the origin of all beings, the sustainer of the
earth, the form of many forms, the originator.

सपीतवस्त्रं सरसीरुहेक्षणम् |
सहारवक्ष:स्थलकौस्तुभश्रियं
