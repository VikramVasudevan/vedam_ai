नमामि विष्णुं शिरसा चतुर्भुजम् ॥ ६॥

saSamkhacakram sakiritakurndalam
Sapitavastram sarasiruhéksanam,
saharavaksahsthalasobhikaustubham
namami visnum sirasa caturbhujam. (6)

I bow before the God Vishnu,

Who has four arms,

Who has a conch and wheel in his hands,
Who wears a crown and ear globes,
Who wears yellow silks,

Who has lotus like eyes,

Who shines because of Kousthbha gem worn on his garlanded

chest.

I seek refuge in Lord Krishna,
Who is with Rukhmani and Satyabhama,
Who sits on a golden throne in the shade of Parijata tree,
Who is of the colour of the black cloud,
Who has long broad eyes,
Who has a face like moon,

Who has four hands,
And who has a chest adorned by Sreevatsa.
